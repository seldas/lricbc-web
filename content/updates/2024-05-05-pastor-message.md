Martin Luther’s Preface to The Epistle to the Romans

（continue from above）

(e) Righteousness

18.Now, faith such as I described is ‘righteousness,’ and is called the righteousness of God, or the righteousness that is valid in God’s sight, because He bestows it and counts it for righteousness for the sake of Christ, our Mediator. This righteousness causes a person to render to each his due. For through faith man becomes void of sin and conceives a love for the commandments of God. Thus he gives due honour to God and pays Him what he owes. On the other hand, he willingly serves his fellow-man in whatever way he can, and in that way also pays his debts to everybody. Such righteousness human nature, man’s free will, and our powercannot achieve. For just as little as anybody can kindle faith in himself, just as little can he remove this unbelief. How, then, is he to remove one single sin, even of the paltriest kind? Therefore, whatsoever is done without faith or in unbelief, no matter what a splendid appearance it may present, is falsehood, hypocrisy, and sin. Rom. 14:23.

(f) Flesh and Spirit

19. As regards the term ‘flesh’ and ‘spirit’ in this epistle, you must not understand ‘flesh’ to mean only unchaste matters, nor ‘spirit’ to mean the inward matters of the heart. St. Paul, as well as Christ in John 3:6, calls everything flesh that is born of flesh, hence the entire person with his body and soul, his reason and all his senses, because everything in him lusts after the flesh. Thus you will understand that you must call any person ‘carnal’ who is full of his own imaginations concerning sublime, spiritual matters, teaching and twaddling about them. You can readily gather this from what is said concerning the works of the flesh in Gal. 5:20, where also heresy and hatred are called works of the flesh. Moreover, in Rom. 8:3, the apostle says that the Law is weakened by the flesh. This does not refer to unchastity, but to all sins, chiefly, however, to unbelief, which is the greatest vice affecting the spirit.

20. On the other hand, you will have to call even that person ‘spiritual’ who is engaged in most obvious work, as, for instance, Christ when He was washing His disciples feet, and Peter when he was rowing his boat and fishing. Accordingly, ‘flesh’ denotes a person who spends his life inwardly and outwardly in serving the interests of his flesh and temporal existence, while ‘spirit’ denotes a person who spends his life inwardly and outwardly in serving the spirit and the interests of the life to come.

21. Without this understanding of the terms noted you will never grasp this epistle of St. Paul, nor any book of the Holy Scriptures. Therefore, beware of all teachers who employ these words in a different sense, no matter who they are, even if they should happen to be Jerome, Augustine, Ambrose, Origen, and men like them or still higher than they.

Part II. Now we shall take the Epistle itself.

Ch. 1—The Gross Sins of Men

22. It behoves a preacher of the Gospel, first of all, by means of the revelation of the Law concerning sins, to reprove and denounce as sin everything in a person’s life that does not proceed from the Spirit and from faith in Christ, in order that men be enabled to know themselves and their misery, become humble, and crave help. Therefore St. Paul, following this rule, starts in the first chapter to rebuke gross sins and unbelief which are manifest, such as the sins of the Gentiles were and as are still in those who live without the grace of God. He says that by the Gospel is revealed the wrath of God from heaven upon all men because of their ungodliness and unrighteousness. For although they know, and perceive every day, that there is a God, still their nature, outside of grace, is in itself so evil that they neither thank Him nor honour Him, but inflict blindness on themselves and without ceasing fall into worse evils, until, after practising idolatry, they commit, without shame, the most abominable sins and every vice and, moreover, do not rebuke them in others.

Ch. 2—Hypocrisy and Self-righteousness

23. In the second chapter this reproof is still further extended, so as to embrace those who are outwardly pious or sin in secret. Of this class were the Jews, and are all hypocrites today, who lead a good and honest life without real love for it, because at heart they are enemies of God’s Law. Yet they are ready to pass judgment on other people, as is the manner of all hypocrites, so as to esteem themselves pure, although they are full of avarice, hatred, pride, and all vileness. Matt. 23:25. These are the very people who despise the goodness of God and heap up wrath for themselves because of their hardness. Thus St. Paul, as a true expounder of the Law, does not suffer anyone to pass for a sinless person, but denounces the wrath of God to all who would lead a good life by their natural strength or free will. He does not suffer them to pass for anything better than manifest sinners; in fact, he tells them that they are hard-hearted

and impenitent.                                                                              (To be continued)

马丁·路德的《罗马书》序言

（接上文）

(e) 公义

18. 我所描述的信心就是‘义’，它被称为神的义，或在神眼中有效的义，因为神为了我们中保基督的缘故赐下它，并算为义 。 这种义使一个人给予他所应得的。 因为通过信心，人就脱离了罪，并热爱上帝的诫命。 因此，他将应有的荣耀归给神，并偿还他所欠的。 另一方面，他愿意尽其所能地为他人服侍，并以这种方式偿还对每个人的债务。 这种正义是人性、人的自由意志、我们的力量所无法达到的。因为正如任何人都无法点燃对自己的信心一样，他也无法消除这种不信。那么，他该如何消除一项罪孽，即使是最微不足道的罪孽呢？ 因此，凡是没有信心或不信的人所做的事，无论外表多么华丽，都是虚假、伪善和罪恶（罗14:23）。

(f) 情欲与灵

19. 关于这封书信中的‘情欲’（flesh）和‘灵’(spirit)这两个词，你们不可将‘情欲’理解为仅指不贞洁的事物，也不要将‘灵’理解为指内心内在的事物。圣保罗以及约翰福音 3 ：6 节中的基督，称一切从肉身生的都是肉身，因此指整个人，包括他的身体和灵魂、他的理性和他所有的感官，因为他里面的一切都贪恋肉体。因此，你会明白，你必须称任何一个对崇高的、灵性的问题充满自己的想象力、教导和胡言乱语的人为“属肉体的”。 你可以很容易地从《加拉太书》中关于肉体行为的说法中得到这一点。 5:20 异端和仇恨也被称为肉体的行为。 此外，在罗马书 8:3，使徒说律法因肉体软弱。 这不是指不贞洁，而是指所有的罪，但主要是指不信，这是影响灵性的最大恶习。

20. 另一方面，即使是那些从事最明显工作的人，你也必须称其为‘属灵的’，例如，基督为门徒洗脚时，彼得划船钓鱼时 。 因此，‘肉体’是指一个人在内心和外在的生活中服务于肉体和现世存在的益处，而“灵”则表示一个人在内心和外在的生活中服务于圣灵和未来生命的益处。

21. 如果不理解所提到的术语，你将永远无法理解圣保罗的这封书信，也无法理解圣经的任何一卷书。 因此，要提防所有在不同意义上使用这些词的教师，无论他们是谁，即使他们碰巧是耶柔米、奥古斯丁、安布罗修、奥利金，以及像他们一样或比他们更高

的人。

### 第二部分: 现在我们要来看这封书信本身。

第一章——人类的重罪

22. 传福音的人首先应该通过关于罪的律法的启示，责备和谴责人在生活中一切不是出于圣灵和对基督的信仰的罪，为了使人们能够了解自己和他们的痛苦，变得谦虚并渴求帮助。因此，圣保罗遵循这一规则，从第一章开始斥责明显的严重罪恶和不信，就像外邦人过去和现在仍然在那些没有上帝恩典的人身上所犯的罪一样。 他说，通过福音，上帝因所有人的不敬虔和不义而从天上向他们显明了愤怒。因为虽然他们知道并且每天都感知到有一位上帝，但他们的本性，在恩典之外，本身就是如此邪恶，以至于他们既不感谢他，也不荣耀他，而是使自己盲目，不断陷入更糟糕的邪恶之中。直到他们在拜偶像之后，毫无羞耻地犯下最可憎的罪孽和一切恶习，而且他们也不在别人身上责备这些罪孽。

第二章——虚伪和自以为义

23. 在第二章中，这种责备进一步延伸，以涵盖那些表面虔诚或暗地里犯罪的人。 犹太人就属于这一类人，他们今天都是伪君子，他们过着美好而诚实的生活，却没有真正热爱它，因为他们在内心深处是上帝律法的敌人。 然而，他们却随时准备对他人做出评判，就像所有伪善者的做法一样，以自以为纯洁，尽管他们充满了贪婪、仇恨、骄傲和一切卑鄙。 太23:25 这些人正是藐视上帝的良善，并因自己的刚硬而为自己积聚愤怒的人。 因此，圣保罗作为律法的真正解释者，不会允许任何人被视为无罪之人，而是谴责上帝对所有靠自然力量或自由意志过上美好生活的人的愤怒。 他不允许他们被视为比明显的罪人更好的人。事实上，他告诉他们，他们铁石心肠，不知悔改。
