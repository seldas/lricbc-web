**11/9/25 Pastor’s Word**
An Initiative Reflection on John Sung

(continued from the above)

Xiamen

· John Sung in Xiamen

The Second Nationwide Bible Institute (1936)

Another significant event was the Second Nationwide Bible Institute, held in Xiamen from July 10 to August 8, 1936 by John Sung. [1] The newly built Trinity Church on Gulangyu was completed just in time, able to seat 1,600 people. [2] The conference drew about 2,000 delegates, including representatives from Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines. For a full month, thousands studied the entire Bible together—a truly stirring scene.

Cai Zhicheng (蔡志澄) recorded John Sung’s opening message, “The Mission of This Bible Institute”, [3] in which Sung expressed gratitude for God’s providence and recounted how the Lord had impressed upon him to hold the second national Bible conference in Xiamen after his evangelistic tour in Southeast Asia, where over 5,000 came to faith. Seeing the spiritual decline and spread of heresy after earlier revivals, Sung believed this institute was God’s means to equip believers and strengthen the church. He expounded 1 Timothy 1, drawing six key truths for the conference:

“1. Discern Between Truth and Falsehood — Verses 3–4

In these last days, heresies and false teachings arise everywhere like raging fires, confusing the ears of many. Without vigilance, one may easily stumble. Last year, when I went to minister in the Nanyang region, soon after I left, there were people preaching strange doctrines, saying that one must be baptized two or three times to be saved. Such heresies shook the faith of the weaker brothers and sisters. I fear that similar situations may also have occurred elsewhere. May the Lord grant us this time a spirit of discernment, that we may distinguish between truth and falsehood, right and wrong, and not fall into Satan’s snares.

2. The Path of Love — Verse 5

Our love for the Lord is far too shallow. The love of those who truly love Him is even more intimate than the affection between husband and wife. The Song of Songs portrays precisely such an intimate relationship between Christ and His people. That pure and sincere love is what every Christian ought to possess. May the Lord lead us onto the road of love, that our love for Him may grow deeper day by day.

3. Humble to the End — Verses 6–11

Those who have received grace often fall into a common disease: following in the footsteps of the Pharisees—despising all others and becoming proud and arrogant. Rich spiritual blessings are often lost through pride. At last year’s institute in Hangzhou, the Spirit was poured out abundantly; many brothers and sisters were greatly refreshed by the heavenly rain and, filled with new courage, bore fruitful testimony for the Lord. Yet at that very moment, Satan took advantage of the situation—some began to boast of themselves, and they fell, never to rise again. How pitiful! May the Lord help us to overcome ourselves, to be willing to die and live together with Him, and to offer ourselves fully for His use.

4. Glorify the Holy Name — Verse 17

When we go out to preach and people do not welcome us, we often revert to our old temper and lash out in anger, blaming others. But we must all pass through such a stage. The Apostle Paul, after receiving his divine calling, never exalted himself. He knew well that he had no strength of his own—everything came from the grace and love of the Lord. In other words, he gave all the glory to the Lamb who was slain for him.

5. Fight the Good Fight — Verse 18

There can be no compromise between the believer and the devil. Though Christians may seem small and powerless, through the victorious Lord they can do all things and are more than conquerors. On my recent southbound voyage, there were 180 young students aboard who had received military training. Their spirits were high, full of heroic vigor. In their minds there seemed to be only a grand future ahead, with not a trace of fear or hesitation. May all who are present likewise undergo spiritual military training, becoming soldiers of Christ who fight the good fight on the battlefield!

6. Keep a Good Conscience and Purify Yourself — Verses 19–20

Many believers have lost their conscience and live in sin and confusion, like a broken ship tossed upon the vast ocean, beaten and battered by the waves, in danger of sinking at any time. We must earnestly ask our Lord to discipline us, to save us, to rescue us from the raging sea of iniquity, and to bring us safely to the other shore, that we may become people who are completely saved!

Conclusion

Finally, may the merciful Spirit and the God of love pour out these blessings upon us richly and abundantly, filling us completely. Amen!”

Within one month, John Sung led the entire assembly through all 66 books and 1,189 chapters of the Bible. Remarkably, 972 participants attended the full session. Sung often studied and prepared sermons until midnight, rising again at three or four in the morning.

On July 26, he led an outdoor Bible study behind Yude School, despite heavy rain. People stood quietly under umbrellas, which together formed a canopy of unity. Many lingered long afterward, deeply moved by the Spirit. [4]

On August 4, Sung wrote a short hymn in his diary:

“I lift my eyes—darkness all around,

My heart breaks, and tears fall down.

Running alone on my weary way,

Discouraged, faint, without the crown.

O Lord, walk with me through the vale,

Through shadows deep, Your grace prevails;

Fame and life I can forsake—

If I have You, that is enough!” [5]

At the closing session, Sung exhorted the participants:

“Now this Bible belongs to you. I have merely given you the key—go and unlock its hidden treasures yourselves. May God use you as soldiers of the last days. Though people slander and attack me, I have a clear conscience before God and man. I have spent myself preaching the gospel without seeking a penny. For this whole month I have been shut up like a prisoner, unable to meet visitors, because I had to prepare the spiritual food for you each day…

I pray that God will bless you. Go back and encourage others to study the Bible. Freely you have received; freely give…

Before the conference began, I asked God for three things: cool weather, spiritual vitality, and good health for all. God answered beyond my expectations! The weather was cool, the meetings grew stronger each day, and those who felt weak were restored through prayer. Hallelujah! Glory to the Lord!

Finally, may God be with you until the Lord returns. Amen!” [6]

The meetings deeply moved Miss Tena Holkeboer, principal of The Amoy Girls’ Middle School, who described it in a letter to a friend as “one of the most profound experiences of my life”—witnessing representatives from across China introduce themselves and sing their favorite hymns. [7]

### Cai Zhicheng later wrote:

“The Holy Bible is indeed the treasure house of truth. Its purpose is lofty, and its power profoundly moving—it is truly the Book of all books in the world, ever new through the ages. It is the divine classic through which God, since ancient times, has revealed His laws, ordinances, and the wondrous way of salvation to humankind by the prophets and holy men of old.

The truths contained in Scripture are rich and unfathomable, inexhaustible to those who seek them. Whoever, under the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit, approaches it with humility and meditation will find endless delight in reading it again and again…

As for the number of participants, it was by no means small; as for the regions represented, they were by no means few. Truly it was an unprecedented assembly. In the short span of a single month, by means of a simple and direct study of both the Old and New Testaments, people were enabled to gain a panoramic view of the whole Bible and to taste deeply the grace of the Spirit—indeed, a most remarkable achievement.” [8]

初谈宋尚节

（接上文）

宋尚节在厦门

第二届全国查经大会

另一件重要的事件是1936年7月10日至8月8日宋尚节带领在厦门举办的第二届全国查经大会（The Second Nationwide Bible Institute）。[1] 鼓浪屿的三一堂抢在大会之前盖好，堂内可容纳一千六百人。[2]大会共有约两千名代表参加，其中不少人远道而来，包括台湾、新加坡、马来西亚和菲律宾等。数千人共同用一个月时间查考整本圣经，场面极为震撼。蔡志澄记下了此次大会开幕式上宋尚节所讲的“本届查经大会的使命”：[3]

“感谢主赞美主叫我们这第二届全国基督徒布道团查经会，得于今晚依期开幕。召集大会原非易事，幸蒙上主亲自作为其间，诸事乃得顺适如意。客秋，曾一度至南洋群岛为主作证，蒙恩者5000余人，饥渴慕义可见一斑，临行时，1000多人挥泪送别，状极伤感，登轮后独自一人关门恳吁上主垂怜这一般乏牧喂养的群羊。忽听微音，促余在厦举办第二届查经大会。感谢主竟自完成他所应许的话。回国后周行南北继续作证，眼看各处兄姊在奋兴后一片热诚低落千丈，轻信左道异端，走失迷途者比比皆是，更叫我坚心靠主完成本届查经会的使命。同时有北平等好几个地方，要我到他们那边去开查经会，可是为要顺服主的旨意，就决定在厦门举行了。

到底这次查经大会使命何在？我们也不能不细心思想。上帝选召我们原要造就我们做个良好的工人，忠勇的战士。在这末世主快再临的时候，上帝再三催促我们要起来担负他所付托我们的职责！我们到这里来，并不是为物质上的享乐，乃要付相当代价追求真理的实在。好像这次从沪到厦同行者80多人，受不了风浪颠荡，许多人晕吐僵卧备尝辛苦，叫我不禁伤感流泪。同行的人，束手无策只好用吟诗祈祷互相安慰。上帝愛我们召我们到达此地，要我们在真道上打定根基，希望大家多用安静工夫或在山上，或在密室，恳切求主指示，叫我们更加认清此来的使命。现在请看提摩太前书第一章，这里所提的6点很可以做我们本届查经大会的参考：

辨别真伪——3，4节。在这末世时代左道邪说，到处烽起，淆乱听闻，一不小心必至跌倒。去年我到南洋一带工作，一走之后，就有人传讲须受浸两三次………才能得救等异端，动摇软弱兄姊的信心，其他各处恐怕也有同样的情形发生。希望主这次赐给我们一个辨别真伪是非之灵，叫我们不致误堕撒旦的网络。

愛心道路——5节。我们愛主的心，太浅薄了。真诚愛主的人较诸夫妇之愛还亲密。雅歌一书即在描写基督徒间的亲密关系。那种纯洁、真挚的愛心是我们每个基督徒应有的。求主领导我们跑上愛的道路，叫我们愛主之心，一天深似一天。

谦卑到底——6至11节。蒙恩的人常常犯了一种通病，步教法师的后尘，目空一切，高傲自大。丰富的灵恩就因着高傲断送去了。去年杭州大会的时候，灵恩沛然下降，多少弟兄姊妹大受灵雨滋润，勇气百倍，为主作证成绩斐然，魔鬼也在那个时候乘虚而入，叫一部分的人夸耀自己，一蹶不能复振，真太可怜。求主帮助我们克服自己，情愿与他同死同生，献给主用。

荣耀圣名——17节。当我们向外布道，人家不喜欢的时候，常要故态复萌闹出气，责骂别人。其实我们都要经过这个阶段，使徒保罗蒙了恩召他并未夸张自己，且深知自己毫无力量，完全出乎主之恩愛，换句话说，他把一切的荣耀归给为他被杀的羔羊。

打美好仗——18节。信徒和恶魔绝无妥协的余地。信徒虽然渺小无为，但靠凯旋之主凡事必能得胜有余。此番南下船中有180几个受过军事训练的青年学生，他们的精神饱满英气万分。在他们的思想中好像只有远大的将来，没有丝毫的怯懦彷徨混杂其间。但愿在座同道个个都受属灵的军事训练，成为基督的精兵，在战场上打美好的胜仗！

保守良心，洁净自己——19，20节。许多信徒，良心丧失，在罪恶中混沌过活，有如汪洋扁舟，被风浪打得破烂不堪，覆沉堪虞！我们切要求吾主，管教我们，拯救我们，叫我们冲出孽海的汹涌，延登彼岸，做个完全得救的人！

末了，但愿慈悲之灵、愛人的上帝把这些恩赐，丰丰富富的浇灌我们，充满我们，阿门！ ”

宋尚节在一个月之内带领会众查考整本66卷圣经，一千一百八十九章。令人赞叹的是，有972人全程参加。期间，宋尚节有时晚上备课到十二点，凌晨三四时又起来继续准备。他似乎预示到大雨将至，心中有极强的紧迫感，嗷嗷待哺的小羊需要装备，免得他们在风雨中走迷道路。七月二十六日早上，在毓德学校后山开露天查经会，天降大雨，许多人撑起伞，伞伞相连，形成一个合一的屏障，大家在雨中肃然而立，安静听道。会后，许多人仍留在雨中，心中涌出的感动久久不能平静。[4]

### 八月四日，宋尚节在日记中写了一首短歌：

“举目四面是黑暗，不觉伤心下泪。

靠自己奔跑前程，孤单灰心失志。

求我主与我同行，领我经过幽谷，

名利生命可丢弃，有主可说够了！”[5]

在大会闭幕时，宋尚节说到：“这本圣经算是你们的了。现在你们要带出去。我不过是送给你们一把钥匙，你们回去还要自己研究，里面有许多隐藏的宝贝，等候你们自己去开发。但愿上帝重用你们，为末世的精兵——这是这一次查经会最大的目标…… 虽然人家攻击毁谤，可是我只觉得在上帝与人之间无愧。我只是拼命的传福音，不贪取一块钱；同时我在这一个月中，好像被囚在监狱里，好多人要见我，实在抱歉得很。然而，这是出乎万不得已的，因为我每天都要预备分给大家的灵粮，忙得不可开交……

此外，我还要求上帝祝福你们，巴不得你们回去，到各地方鼓励查经。亲愛的兄弟姊妹！不要亏欠上帝的荣耀，你们白白得来的恩赐，也要白白的施舍出去……

我还告诉你们上帝奇妙的恩典。在还未开会以前，我求上帝三件事：一、天气凉快；二、聚会有良好的精神；三、会员身体平安。感谢主！他愛我们，不但叫天气特别凉快，还使聚会的精神一天比一天好。会员中虽有几位身体软弱的，然而一经祷告身体就好了。哈利路亚！荣耀归主！……

末了，愿上帝与你们同在，直到主再来！阿门！”[6]

这次聚会深深感动了一位教育传教士——在厦门女子中学（The Amoy Girl’s Middle School）任校长的霍尔克博尔小姐（Miss Tena Holkeboer）。她在写给朋友的信中说，那是“自己最深刻的经历”——看到来自中国各地的代表团被介绍给会众，并聆听他们各自献上最喜愛的圣诗。[7]

### 后来，蔡志澄评价道：

“夫圣经者真理之宝藏也。其宗旨之正大。感力之雄伟。诚为世上万书之书。历万古而常新。盖即上帝亘古以来。藉诸先圣先知将其律例典章救恩妙道。昭示世人之经典也。经中真理丰富深远。令人取之不尽用之不竭。凡蒙圣神启示。心虚玩索。必能百读不厌津津有味也……以言人数不谓不多。以言区域不谓不广。实空前之盛会。而以一月时光采用单纯式考查新旧约书。使一般人士得窥圣经全豹。饱尝灵恩滋味。尤称壮举”。[8]
