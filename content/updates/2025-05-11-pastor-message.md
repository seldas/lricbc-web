Receive Find Joy in Time for Mother’s Day

Joy in the Journey

But may all who search for you be filled with joy and gladness in you. May those who love your salvation repeatedly shout, “The Lord is great!”  — Psalm 40:16, NLT

One hundred and sixty-nine miles. That is the distance Ellie drove her kids in one day. Multiple times a week. Just for after-school activities. Many of us have been there, right? Whether we are commuting, driving toddlers to preschool or older students to volleyball or youth group—or all of the above—many women can relate to spending lots of time in the car.

It is easy to start feeling, I was made for more than this. To feel burdened. Put upon.

Ellie had originally started tracking her miles for fun. But watching the odometer tick over soon brought frustration. Every time she got into the driver’s seat, dread bubbled to the surface. And if her children acted irritable about being in the car for so long, watch out! Long gone was the compassionate mom—she was replaced by an on-edge woman who snapped that it was their choice to do the activities, not hers.

One particular day, the traffic was horrible, her girls were grumpy, and they were late. Ellie was fed up. She dropped them off and decided to walk outside instead of trying to cram in an errand. She walked along, discouraged and stressed...and then it started to rain.

She finally looked up to the sky to talk to God about this. (Because really? Rain? Now?!) That’s when she noticed that it was raining only on her. What a perfect message from God about her mood. But more importantly, she was stunned to see that the rest of the sky was filled with indescribable, movie-worthy clouds. If it had not started raining, she would not have paused to look up and see this glorious sight.

If it had not started raining, she would not have paused to look up and see this glorious sight.

Thank you, God, she whispered. Thank you for forcing me to pause and see this.

She took tons of pictures, eager to share them with her girls. Then she realized: the beauty had not only caused her to pause her discouragement long enough to see something worthy of praise, it had also caused her to turn her thoughts to something she could show her kids, something they could praise God for as well.

She also realized something else. Those cloud formations had probably been their during her whole drive, and she had totally missed them. What would happen if she stopped dreading each drive and started eagerly looking for what God would show her each day?

Sisters, how often is there such beauty above us—something we miss until God sends a little rainstorm to wake us up? The next time we are on our last nerve because of an unexpected delay, a broken-down car, or an interruption in a packed schedule, look up. Let’s look for what God is trying to show us that will give us joy in the journey.

“Blessed are they who see beautiful things in humble places where other people see nothing.”

### 在母亲节，领受喜乐：在旅程中发现满足

在旅程中的喜乐

“愿一切寻求你的，因你高兴欢喜。愿那些喜爱你救恩的，常说：‘当尊耶和华为大！’”

### 诗篇 40:16

一百六十九英里。这是 Ellie 一天内为送孩子们参加课外活动所开车的总里程数，而且这样的一天一周要发生好几次。我们当中的许多人都经历过这样的情形吧？不管是通勤、送学步的孩子去上学前班，或是接送大孩子去排球训练、青少年聚会——或甚至这些全都包含在内——很多女性都能理解花大量时间坐在车里的感受。

这样的生活很容易让人觉得：“我被造不是为了这样的琐事。”觉得沉重、觉得被压得喘不过气。

Ellie 起初记录行车里程只是为了好玩。但随着里程表数字的不断跳动，她的心情却愈发烦躁。每次坐进驾驶座，她心里都会泛起一阵厌烦。如果孩子们在车里因为久坐而发脾气，那就更糟糕了——那个温柔体贴的妈妈不见了，取而代之的是一个情绪紧绷、容易暴怒的女人，她会怒斥孩子：“这是你们选择的活动，又不是我非要你们去！”

有一天，交通特别糟糕，女儿们情绪低落，而且她们还迟到了。Ellie 再也忍不住了。她送完孩子后，决定不去赶行程，而是出去走走。她边走边感到沮丧和紧张……这时，竟然下起了雨。

她终于抬起头来向神倾诉这一切。（“真的？现在下雨？”）但她这才发现，居然只下在她一个人身上！这正是神对她心情的一个完美写照。但更重要的是，她惊讶地看到，其余的天空竟然布满了难以形容、如电影般壮观的云朵。若不是这场雨，她根本不会停下来抬头仰望这壮丽的画面。

若不是下雨，她根本不会停下来仰望这壮丽的画面。

“谢谢你，上帝。”她轻声说道，“谢谢你让我停下来，看见这一切。”

她拍了许多照片，想着要和女儿们分享。然后她意识到：这景象不仅让她从沮丧中暂时抽离，转而看见值得称颂的美好，也让她想到可以与孩子们一同分享、一起赞美神的理由。

她也意识到另一个事实：这些云彩可能在她整个开车途中就已经在那里了，但她却完全错过了。她开始思考：如果她不再对每次接送心生厌烦，而是期待着每天神要向她展示的事物，会发生什么？

姐妹们，我们多少次都是这样？那样的美好常常就在我们头顶之上，只是我们直到神差来一场小雨，才被唤醒、才愿意抬头。下次当你因突发的延误、抛锚的汽车，或是排得满满的行程被打断而情绪濒临崩溃时——抬头吧。去看看神要向你显明什么，看看那能带给你旅途喜乐的事物。

“有福的人，是那些在卑微之处仍能看见美好的人，而别人却看不见。”

——卡米耶·毕沙罗（Camille Pissarro）
