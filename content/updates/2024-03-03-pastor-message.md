In Memory of Elder Guo Shouzhong

Chunhai Li

Hebrews 13:7 (KJV): Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.

Our church (Little Rock Immanuel Chinese Baptist Church in Little Rock, USA) has recently been studying the Book of Acts. In Acts, the apostles were accompanied by miracles and great power in their preaching, but they also faced much persecution. Tertullian, an early church father, said, “The blood of martyrs is the seed of the Church.” The ending of Acts mentions Paul freely preaching in Rome without hindrance. This open-ended conclusion suggests that after Peter and Paul, successive generations of saints will continue to write Acts, following the path of self-sacrifice along the way of the cross of Jesus, running the heavenly road until the Lord comes again. This reminds me of Elder Guo Shouzhong. He was the founder of the Christian Church in my hometown, Hegang, Heilongjiang Province, China. He once guided us and preached the word of God to us. His faith is worthy of emulation, and we should consider his glorious life (Hebrews 13:7).

In 1995, Elder Guo Shouzhong, who was 82 years old at the time, came to the Xinhua Church in Hegang City to preach and baptized many brothers, sisters, and me after I become a believer. (At that time, it was sprinkling baptism. In September 2008, after coming to the United States, I received baptism in immersion and joined the Southern Baptist Church. Baptists believe that baptism is not a prerequisite for salvation but a sign of obedience to Christ and joining the church. I am willing to testify to the Lord’s obedience through baptism before others. This does not deny the fact that I was already saved by faith in Christ) When Elder Guo testified to his salvation, he said, “I used to be a great sinner, I did all kinds of evil, I smoked opium in the old society, my morals were corrupt. Thank the Lord Jesus, He saved me, let me realize that I am a sinner, repent of my sins, and obtain eternal life. He also chose me as a preacher.” After one Lord’s Supper, an older sister brought her younger sister who was possessed by a mute evil spirit to the front to ask Elder Guo for prayer. The elder humbly knelt down and prayed for her, driving out the demon. After the prayer, the younger sister immediately began to speak. Everyone was amazed and shouted ‘Hallelujah,’ giving glory to God. Unfortunately, that sister did not end well. She never came to church again. When I met her again, she was running around on the street in a crazy manner. Elder Qian Lihua, the former leader of Xinhua Church, said, “The most impressive thing about Elder Guo is that he never accepts gifts from others. I remember one time I was under attack by the devil, feeling very uncomfortable, almost losing control. At that time, my coworkers took me to a small house. Elder Guo prayed in tongues for me. After the prayer, I immediately recovered, and I have never had that illness again. As for speaking in tongues, I don’t know if others’ tongues are from God, but I am sure that Elder Guo’s tongues must be from God.”

Thank God, during the process of gathering materials, He arranged for me to contact Elder Ding Xianwen, the son of Elder Guo. He generously provided many valuable historical photos. According to the historical records provided by Elder Ding, Guo Shouzhong was born on October 4, 1913, in Tonghutong, Jiamusi, Heilongjiang Province. He grew up in poverty and only received six years of formal education. At the age of 15, he began apprenticing and learning Mandarin, and at 18, he worked in a grain store in Xingde Town, Jiamusi. He became a Christian in 1936 and in 1937, following God’s will, he went to the North China Baptist Theological Seminary in Huangsien, Shandong Province, under extremely difficult conditions.[2] From this, we can see that Elder Guo was influenced by the famous Shandong Revival (1927-1937) in history. He graduated from the seminary in June 1940 and served as a preacher in Shandong for half a year. In October 1940, he returned to Jiamusi to continue his preaching work. In December 1940, he moved his family to Hegang and began preaching there. In 1945, he established the Hegang Church at the northern end of Xijie, Hegang. When it was officially established, there were 80 people gathering, and Elder Guo lived and worked in the church. On December 25, 1946, Christmas, there were 120 people gathering. At the end of 1946, Wu Zhizhong, from Gongnong District, led 30 people to break into the church, attack reactionary preachers, and take away all the church’s furniture, organ, and Bible. The church moved to Elder Guo’s home for meetings, with more than 30 people attending. During the Cultural Revolution in 1966, the church was closed. In 1970, when China began implementing religious policies again, there were over 2,000 baptized Christians in Hegang.

On December 25, 1971, during a Christmas gathering at Guo’s home, located at 30 Building, 11 Households, Committee 7, Group 8, Xingshan Gongzhu Street, there were 32 people in the photograph. On November 5, 1992, Guo was ordained as an elder. He peacefully passed away on August 24, 2001, at the age of 89. Sister Zhan Huilin from our church in Hegang testified, “I don’t know much about Elder Guo because I wasn’t a believer at that time. My mother was a believer. In the 1980s and 1990s, Elder Guo influenced a generation of Christians in Hegang. So many people came to faith because of him. At that time, the church led by Elder Guo was truly revitalized, with people filling every floor.”

Elder Ding recounted, “My father became a Christian in 1936. At that time, he knelt in the church and prayed, saying, ‘Lord Jehovah, you are the true God, please heal my grandfather’s paralysis. My grandfather has been bedridden for two years. If you allow my grandfather to walk again, I will believe that you are the living God, and I will dedicate my life to serving You as a preacher.’ Three days later, his grandfather indeed began to walk again.

In 1937, God led him to attend seminary. He prayed to God, saying, ‘I want to go to seminary, so I will entrust my family to God and ask for His provision.’ My father signed up for seminary through the church without his family knowing. After he left, my third uncle, who was promoted to be a manager at a fire mill, provided for our entire family. So, we had a better life than when my father was at home.

During his time at the seminary, some of Chinese bread they received were moldy. While other students refused to eat them, he did. When he ate them, they tasted as delicious as cake. After graduating from seminary, he returned to Hegang to preach. He preached the gospel on the streets and went door-to-door. Preaching was very difficult at that time, and there were times when he went without food. Life was hard, but his spirit was joyful and happy.

He faced persecution and hardships multiple times, a total of three times. In 1958, because of his faith, he spent three years in a labor camp. When I visited him, he told me that it was God’s arrangement for him to eat well there. At that time, we were starving at home. He lived in a cowshed. He cooked some corn in the middle of the night that the cows ate so he never got hungry. Spiritually, he prayed and communed with the Lord during those three years. His spiritual life was very rich. Through the refining of those three years, he personally witnessed that God is truly alive.

My father preached for the Lord for 56 years, without accepting any salary from the church or spending any of the church’s money. He never accepted gifts from any brothers or sisters. He preached during the day and wrote sermons at night, often writing until midnight. I saw God’s grace and glory in my father. He healed the sick, cast out demons, performed many miracles, and had a great gift of preaching. The whole city of Hegang was shocked when my father died. 8,000 people went to the funeral, in 40 buses and in 50 minibuses. The person at the funeral home sighed and said: ‘Who is this person? More people attended his funeral than attended the mayor’s funeral. My father’s life was a life that glorified God and was blessed by God!”

Elder Shen Yulan testified, “I started attending church in 1980. At that time, I was busy with work and didn’t attend gatherings much. Elder Guo’s ministry was truly outstanding. When he led Bible studies, he always focused on interpreting scriptures through scriptures. He didn’t talk about personal matters but exalted Jesus Christ, teaching how to imitate the Lord through reading the Bible, praying, and praising. During his sermons, he often inserted a hymn. He led Bible studies, covering every chapter from Genesis to Revelation.”

Continuing, Sister Shen said, “He faced a lot of persecution. When there were disagreements among the deacons, he always encouraged brothers and sisters to look to the Lord. At that time, there were restrictions on the number of people who could be baptized. He encouraged brothers and sisters to pray and let the Lord work. We should look to the Lord, look to the cross, and follow the Lord. The Lord was so humble; even when He was beaten and bruised on the cross, He said, ‘Father, forgive them.’ We should also forgive others.

Elder Guo served as an elder for many years and was criticized by the Red Guards. During the interrogations, when it was Elder Guo’s turn, he had a vision of a tiger with a seal on its mouth. When the Red Guards interrogated him, they said, ‘Let’s go eat first, and then we’ll continue the interrogation.’ After they finished eating, there was no further interrogation. Later, Elder Guo did various jobs in prison, such as raising chickens.

While in prison, Elder Guo’s wife visited him and sang to encourage him: ‘And now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in You. Deliver me from all my transgressions; do not make me the scorn of the fool’ (Psalm 39:7-9). After singing, both of them shed tears.

When he was released from prison, the police asked him, ‘Will you continue preaching?’ He replied, ‘What I say doesn’t matter; what God says does. How could I disobey God and not preach?’ Other preachers would say, ‘I won’t preach anymore,’ but in their hearts, they would think, ‘How can I not preach?’ Elder Guo was consistent in his heart and speech, never sinning with his mouth. They went to the police station once a week for reporting. The police asked him, ‘Have you been preaching?’ He answered, ‘Believers just gather together to sing songs.’”

I asked, “What is the most valuable lesson you learned from Elder Guo?”

Sister Shen replied, “First, he was very meticulous about himself. When he preached, he would always distribute the outline of his sermon to the believers beforehand. After reading the Bible verses, he would close his eyes throughout the sermon. He memorized the entire sermon and delivered it from beginning to end. Second, he was exceptionally loving. Brothers and sisters who came from afar for gatherings, he and his wife would not let them leave, but instead, they would invite everyone to eat, serving potatoes and China northern pumpkins. They would also offer accommodations to everyone.”

My Aunt Chen Hongxia said, “The sermon notes left by him are still in our home, all handwritten by him. The image of Elder Guo’s appearance and his smile is vivid in my mind; I have heard and seen it all. After I became a believer in 1983, I started attending gatherings at Elder Guo’s home in Gouzi North, Xingbei District. We gathered on the heated brick bed. His house was a dilapidated grass hut, packed with people both on and under the bed, inside and outside the house. At that time, I was 21 years old. As soon as I arrived at his house, I climbed onto the bed and fell asleep. Both elders were very gentle and humble, and his wife was very modest. He once said during his sermon, ‘During the Cultural Revolution, when the country opposed religion, he was arrested and interrogated. But he remained faithful. Even if he were beaten to death, he would still believe.’ Later, the church moved to Xiangyang Church. In the 1990s, my younger brother was reported and laid off. We asked Elder Guo to pray. After he prayed in tongues, he said, ‘It’s okay, he will definitely get his job back.’ At that time, Elder Guo was old, and the deacons served him. Every time we asked him to pray, buy something, or give him a gift, he refused. If others asked him to pray or gave him gifts, he would turn the gifts into money and put them in the offering box. The deacons told us, ‘Don’t buy anything anymore; Elder Guo uses his own salary to repay everyone for these thank-you gifts.’ This had the greatest impact on me. When I was a section chief at work and someone gave me gifts in gratitude, I also turned the gifts into money and returned them. I have always been consistent; whenever someone gives me something, I turn it into money and return it in gratitude. Even in difficult times, I still tithe. I never owe anyone.

He led Bible studies, and at that time, I didn’t understand much. His influence on me was the greatest, and he had the greatest influence on our family. If the church leaders that followed him could be as morally clean as Elder Guo in financial matters, they wouldn’t have fallen. It’s a pity that the church where Elder Guo used to serve has now split into factions.

In 1994, I was laid off. I asked him to pray for me. After he prayed, he said, ‘You will definitely return to work in three years.’ I thought to myself, ‘I’ve been laid off, and someone in authority has taken over my job. How can I return?’ But God is truly miraculous; three years later, I did return to work as a custodian. This is not superstition. The words spoken by the elder in prayer have come true. Thank the Lord, everyone I know has nothing but praise for Elder Guo. He never accepts gifts from anyone. This is extremely precious.”

My biological sister, Li Chunyan, testified, “In fact, our family heard the gospel from my aunt’s family. My aunt Chen Hongxia was one of the earliest believers in Elder Guo’s church. Before she believed in the Lord, she worshipped idols and was often bound by demons. After she prayed and read the Bible, the demons fled, and she was healed. When my father and I visited my aunt’s house, my aunt’s elder sister, Chen Hongxia, shared the gospel with my father. She said, ‘This God is the Almighty; he controls everything, even the wind and rain. You can pray to him about anything.’ Inside the gospel pamphlet that my father brought back from my aunt’s house were the Ten Commandments and the Lord’s Prayer. My father hid them behind the mirror at home.

Later, when I was young, I was sent from Xinhua Church to Xiangyang Church for training. Elder Guo and his wife were always at the door welcoming and receiving everyone. They shook hands with each person, served hot water, and warmly invited people into the church. They cared for the poor and the weak meticulously, which made people feel very warm. Their humility and genuine love, which came from the depths of their hearts, were truly touching and admirable. Their children and grandchildren, working in various places, all tithed. Elder Guo loved the Lord too much. He was deeply committed to his faith. Whenever people came to him for prayer, he humbly prayed for them. Even in his old age, when he was not feeling well, he would still get out of bed to pray for others when they asked for his intercession.”

The stories of Elder Guo are countless. Due to space constraints, I will end my writing here. I am especially grateful to God and to the brothers and sisters including Ding Xianwen, Qian Lihua, Shen Yulan, Li Chunyan, Chen Hongxia, Zhao Guiqin, Zhan Huilin, and Zhang Zhongxia for providing their testimonies. May this article serve as a catalyst to inspire more people to delve deeper into Elder Guo’s ministry and to reflect on the state of our faith today. From Elder Guo’s story, we can learn several things:

1. He had a rich spiritual life, combining his gifts with humility. He had a broad mind, embracing everyone, and was greatly used by Christ.

2. He endured the test of being imprisoned during the Cultural Revolution. “These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith—of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed.” (1 Peter 1:7). Elder Guo’s Chinese name Shouzhong means “staying faithfulness.” He remained faithful until the end, steadfast in the way of the Lord, until his last breath.

---
**3. Pastoral care. He served the people of his time with his life and then peacefully passed away. His service was full of humility, love, and care, truly manifesting the love of Christ.**
4. God enjoys playing hide and seek with us. Through writing about Elder Guo’s testimony, I was amazed to discover that the seminary he attended in his youth in China was sponsored by the Southern Baptist Church. I joined the Southern Baptist Church in the United States more than sixteen years ago. After more than thirty years of being a Christian, on February 27, 2024, I was astonished to find that, tracing back to the source, the theological training Elder Guo received is actually from the same source as the church I am currently serving. If the International Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention were to learn about the story of Elder Guo, their former seminary student who later led and influenced thousands of people, including myself, to believe in the Lord in Hegang City, our hearts would rejoice greatly! Elder Guo’s story deserves to be recorded in the history of the Chinese church. The words of the Lord echo in my ears again: “Then I heard a voice from heaven say, ‘Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. ‘Yes,’ says the Spirit, ‘they will rest from their labor, for their deeds will follow them’” (Revelation 14:13).

[2]The North China Baptist Theological Seminary was a Christian theological institution in China in the 20th century, sponsored by the Southern Baptist Convention of North China (Shandong and Northeast). Its predecessor was the Bu Shi School of Divinity, founded by Southern Baptist missionaries Hays and Pugh, initially located in Dengzhou and later moved to Xiaoluanshantuan, Huangxian. In 1931, influenced by the Shandong Revival, the Bu Shi School of Divinity was reorganized into the North China Baptist Theological Seminary to meet the need for training missionaries. It was led by Dean Charles L. Culpepper Sr. The number of students increased from around 10 to over 100. After the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941, Dean Charles L. Culpepper Sr. and other missionaries were imprisoned in Japanese internment camps, and the seminary ceased operations. In 1946, due to the impact of the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communists, the North China Baptist Theological Seminary could not be restored. Dean Charles L. Culpepper Sr.  and others went to Shanghai and he became the president of the China Baptist Theological Seminary.

缅怀郭守忠长老

---
**李春海**
来13：7 从前引导你们、传神之道给你们的人，你们要想念他们，效法他们的信心，留心看他们为人的结局。

我们教会（美国小石城以马内利华语浸信会）最近在学习《使徒行传》。《使徒行传》中的使徒们在传道过程中有神迹伴随，大有能力，同时也受尽许多逼迫。古教会特土良说：“殉道者的血成了福音的种子”。《使徒行传》结尾时讲到保罗在罗马自由传道，并没有人禁止。这个开放性的结尾说明，使徒彼得和保罗之后历代圣徒要不断续写《使徒行传》，他们要前赴后继地沿着耶稣十字架舍己的道路奔走天路，直到主再来。这让我联想到郭守忠长老。他是我老家中国黑龙江鹤岗市基督教会的奠基人。他曾引导我们、传神之道给我们，他的信心值得我们效法，他为人的结局值得我们留心（来13：7）。

我1995年刚信主时，82岁高龄的郭守忠长老到鹤岗市新华教会讲道，并为许多弟兄姐妹和我受洗（当时是点水礼。我于2008年9月来美后，领受浸礼加入美南浸信会教会。浸信会认为，浸礼不是得救的凭据，而是顺服基督加入教会的标志。我愿通过浸礼在众人面前为主作顺服主的见证。但这并不否认我之前已经因信基督得救的事实）。郭长老作他得救的见证时说：“我从前是个大罪人，我无恶不作，在旧社会吸鸦片，道德败坏。感谢主耶稣啊，他救了我，让我认识到自己是罪人，认罪悔改，得到永生。他又拣选我作传道人。”一次圣餐礼讲道后，有一位姐姐带着她被哑巴鬼所附的妹妹来到台前请郭长老祷告。老人家谦卑跪地，为她祷告赶鬼。祷告完后，那人马上开口讲话。大家感到惊讶，高呼哈利路亚，将荣耀归于上帝。可惜的是，那位姐妹没有善始善终。她之后再也没来教会。我再次遇见她时，她疯疯癫癫地在大街上跑。前新华教会的负责人钱丽华长老讲到：“郭长老让人印象最深的就是从不收别人的礼物。我记得自己有一次受魔鬼的攻击，非常难受，整个人几乎失控。那时，同工们把我带到小屋。郭长老用方言为我祷告。祷告完后，我马上就好了，这个病从此再也没有犯过。关于说方言，我不知道别人的方言是否出于神，但我敢肯定的是，郭长老的方言一定出于神。”

感谢主，在搜集材料时，上帝预备可以联络上郭长老的儿子丁献文长老，他慷慨提供了许多宝贵的历史照片。根据丁长老所提供的史料记载，郭守忠出生于1913年10月4日黑龙江佳木斯至铜胡同，童年家贫只读了六年书，15岁开始学徒学汉语，18岁在佳木斯兴德镇粮店里工作。1936年信主。1937年得主旨意在百般困难条件下去山东华县华北浸会神学院[1]，此神学院后迁至山东黄县。从这里可以看到，郭长老有受到历史上著名的山东大复兴（1927-1937）的影响。1940年六月于神学院毕业，在山东做了半年传道工作。1940年10月回到佳木斯做传道工作。1940年12月将家搬到鹤岗，在鹤岗开始传道工作。1945年在鹤岗新街基北头建立鹤岗教会，正式成立时有80人聚会，郭长老吃住在教会作传道布道工作。1946年12月25日，圣诞节有120人聚会。1946年末，工农区吴志忠带领30名群众闯进教堂，打击反动传道人，把教会的桌椅板凳、风琴、教会圣经全都抢走了。教会搬到郭守忠家去聚会，有30多人。1966年文化大革命教会关闭。1970年中国落实宗教政策，教会重新得到复兴的时候，鹤岗市受洗的基督徒有2000多人。1971年12月25日在兴山公助街八委七组30栋11户郭守忠家聚会点圣诞节留影时，照片中有32人。1992年11月5日郭守忠被按立为长老。2001年8月24日荣归天家，享年89岁。我们教会（来自鹤岗的）詹慧鳞姐妹见证说：“我对郭长老了解不太多，因为那时候我还没信主。我妈妈信主了。八十年代和九十年代时，郭长老在鹤岗影响了一代基督徒。多少人因着他信了主。那时候，郭长老所带领的教会实在是太复兴了，楼上楼下坐满了人。”

丁长老口述说：“我父亲1936年信主。当时他跪在教堂里祷告说：‘耶和华啊，你是真神，请医治我爷爷的瘫痪病。我爷爷病卧在床两年了。如果你让我爷爷下地行走，我就信你是活神，并且我终身奉献给神为神作传道”。三天后，他爷爷真的下地行走了。

1937年，神让他上神学。他向神祷告说：‘我要上神学，我就把我的家交给神，求神供养’。我父亲上神学从教会报名，家里人不知道。他偷着就从教会直接去了山东黄县神学院。但是我父亲走以后，我三叔被提升为火磨的经理，供养我们全家。因此，我们比父亲在家时过的日子还好。

在神学院期间，吃的干粮有的都发霉了。别的同学不吃的干粮他吃。但是吃的时候像蛋糕那样香。我父亲从神学院毕业回来在鹤岗市传道。他站在街道上传福音，挨家挨户传道。那时候传道非常艰苦，吃了上顿没下顿。生活那样的艰苦，但是灵里却欢喜快乐啊。

他多次受打击迫害。一共有三次。1958年，为了信主的缘故，他在劳改所三年。我去看望他时他告诉我说这是上帝安排他在这里吃得饱。那时在家里正好挨饿。他住在牛棚里。牛吃的玉米，半夜的时候，他起来煮点儿玉米吃。所以，没有饿着。在灵里面，他这三年与主灵交祷告。他的灵命非常丰盛。经过三年的熬炼造就，让他亲眼看见这是一位又真又活的活神。

我父亲为主传道56年，没有接受教会的工资，没有花过教会一分钱。任何弟兄姊妹送礼他都不接受。他自己白天讲道，晚上写讲章。写讲章常写到半夜。我在父亲身上看到了神的恩典、神的荣耀。有多少弟兄姊妹有疾病，他医病赶鬼，行许多异能，讲道大有恩赐。我父亲去世时震动了整个鹤岗市。有8000人去送葬，大客车40量，小客车50量。殡仪馆的人感叹说：‘这是什么人，比鹤岗市长去世时参加的人还多’。我父亲的一生是荣耀神的一生，也是蒙神赐福的一生！”

沈玉兰长老见证说：“我1980年开始去教会。我那时工作忙，不怎么去聚会。郭长老侍奉的工作做得实在是太到位了。他带查经都是以经解经，他不讲人的事情，只高举耶稣基督，怎么效法主，读经、祷告、赞美。讲道时他常常穿插一首小灵歌。他带领查经会，从《创世记》到《启示录》每节都查过。”

沈姨接着说：“他受逼迫很多。当执事不和睦时，他总是劝弟兄姐妹说我们信主的要在基督里仰望主，仰望三一真神。那时候受洗的人数有名额限制，他就劝勉弟兄姐妹要祷告让主来做事。要仰望主，仰望十字架，跟随主。主何等谦卑，当主被打得遍体鳞伤在十字架上时还说‘父啊，赦免他们’。我们也要饶恕人。

郭长老作监很多年，受到红卫兵批斗。当一个一个人轮着接受审讯时，他见到一个异象，一个老虎嘴上贴着封条。到审讯郭长老时，红卫兵就说：‘我们吃饭去吧，吃完饭后再审’。结果，吃完饭后就没有再审了。后来，郭长老在监狱什么活都干过，比如养鸡什么的。

在监狱时，郭师母去看望郭长老，给他唱歌鼓励他：‘主啊，如今我等什么呢？我的指望在乎你。求你救我脱离一切的过犯，不要使我受愚顽人的羞辱。因我所遭遇的是出于你，我就默然不语’（诗39：7-9）。唱完后，两人都潸然泪下。

从监狱里放出来时，公安局的人问他：‘你还传道吗’？他回答说：‘我说的不算，神说的算。我怎么能违背神不传道呢？’其他的传道人口上说：‘我不传了’但心里说：‘我怎能不传呢？’。在这件事上郭长老心口一致，绝不以口犯罪。他们每周到公安局去一次，接受审问。公安局的人问他：‘你传道了吗？’他回答说：‘信徒只是聚在一起唱唱歌。’”

### 我问说：“你从郭长老身上学到最宝贵的功课是什么？”

沈姨回答说：“第一，他对自己特别严谨。他讲道时，每次都是先把讲章大纲发给信徒。他念了圣经章节之后，全程闭着眼睛讲道。他把讲章背在心里，从头到尾讲出来。第二，他特别有愛心。远路来聚会的弟兄姐妹，他和师母都不让走，留大家吃饭，吃土豆、吃倭瓜。留大家住。”

我姑姥家的大姨陈洪霞见证说：“他讲道时留下的讲章还在黑龙江老家，那些讲章都是用手写的。郭长老的音容笑貌历历在目，我耳闻目睹。我1983年信主后就去兴北区沟子北郭长老家聚会。大家在炕上聚会。他家住着破草房，炕上炕下，屋里屋外都挤满了人。我那时21岁，一到他家就上炕，一上炕就睡觉。两位老人非常温和谦卑，师母一点儿不张扬。他讲道时说：‘文革期间，那时国家反对宗教，他被抓起来拷问。他就是信，打死了也是信’。后来教会搬到向阳堂。90年代我大弟弟被人举报，下岗了。我们请他祷告。他用方言祷告完之后说：‘没事儿，一定能回去工作’。他当时年纪大了，众位执事服侍他。每次请他祷告买东西送给郭长老，他就是不要。其他人找他祷告送给他礼物，他也把礼物变成钱，放到奉献箱里。执事和我们说：“你们不要买东西了，这些感恩的东西长老都用自己的工资去还给对方。这一点对我影响最大。我在工作单位上当段长时，有人给我送礼物感恩我，我也将礼物变成钱还给他们。我始终如一，凡事人给我东西我都变成钱，感恩还回去。在难也要作十分之一奉献。再难也不亏欠别人。

他带领查经学习，我那时都不懂，朦朦胧胧。他对我影响最大，对咱家的影响也最大。后来的教会领袖们如果能像郭长老那样在财物上清洁，他们就不会跌倒了。很可惜，现在郭长老之前所在的教会已经四分五裂了。

1994年我下岗了。我找他祷告。他祷告完之后说：‘三年以后一定回去工作’。我想自己下岗了，有当官的人把我工作顶替了，我怎么能回去呢？神真的奇妙，三年之后真的回去了，我又当了保管员。这真的不是迷信。长老祷告出来的话都应验了。感谢主，我所有认识的人对郭长老的评价没有说三道四的。他从来不收任何人的礼物。这一点非常宝贵。”

我姐姐李春艳见证说：“实际上，我们家听到福音就是从我姑姥家那里得来的。姑姥是郭长老教会最早的信徒。我姑姥之前拜偶像，常受魔鬼捆绑，信主之后一祷告读经鬼就跑了，她得到了医治。我和咱爸去姑姥家串门时，姑姥家的大姨陈洪霞把福音传给咱爸。她说，这位上帝是老天爷，刮风下雨他都管，什么事都能向他祷告。爸爸从姑姥家拿回来的福音单张里有十条诫命和主祷文。爸爸把它们藏在家里的镜子后面。

后来我年纪小，从新华教会派去到向阳堂培训时，郭长老和师母每次都在门口守望接待。他们和每个人握手，给人倒水，特别温暖地把人引到教会来。哪个贫穷的、软弱的，他们都照顾得无微不至，特别让人心里暖暖的。他们那种谦卑的、真正从内心发出来实实在在的愛真的令人感动和钦佩。他们的儿女子孙在各地工作，都作十分之一奉献。郭长老太愛主了。他信主信得太投入了。什么时候人们来求他祷告，他都非常谦卑地为他们祈祷。他年老时，即使是自己不舒服，当别人求他代祷他都艰难地起来为人代祷。”

郭长老的故事不胜枚举。由于篇幅所限，我到此止笔。特别感谢上帝，也感谢丁献文、钱丽华、沈玉兰、李春艳、陈洪霞、詹慧鳞、赵桂芹、张忠霞等弟兄姐妹所提供的见证。愿借此文抛砖引玉，可以唤起更多人去深入探索郭长老的服侍，并反思我们今日的信仰光景。从郭长老的故事中我们至少可以学习几点：

1. 他有丰盛的属灵生命，他的恩赐与谦卑结合。他有着宽广的心胸，海纳百川有容乃大，为基督所大用。

2.他为主经受住文革时作监的考验。 “我们的信心既被试验，就比被火试验仍然能坏的金子更显宝贵，可以在主耶稣基督显现的时候，得着称赞、荣耀、尊贵“（彼前1：7）。郭守忠的名副其实，他至死忠心，坚守主道，直到生命的最后一刻。

3.牧者情怀。他用生命服侍了他那个时代的人就睡去了。他的服侍中充满了谦卑、愛心和关怀，真正将基督的愛彰显出来。

4. 上帝喜欢与我们玩捉迷藏游戏。通过写郭长老的见证我惊讶地发现，郭长老年轻时读的神学院居然是美南浸信会（Southern Baptist Church）在中国主办的。我十六年前来美国后加入美南浸信会。在信主30多年后2024年2月27日我惊奇地发现，追根溯源，郭长老所受的神学训练居然和我现在所参加的教会同属一源。如果美南浸信会国际宣教部（International Mission Board）得知他们所培养出的神学生郭守忠后来的故事，他在鹤岗市带领和影响了包括我在内的成千上万人信主，我们的心将会是何等地欢喜！郭长老的故事值得在中国教会历史上留下一笔。主的话又在耳畔回荡： “我听见从天上有声音说：‘你要写下：从今以后，在主里面而死的人有福了！’圣灵说：‘是的，他们息了自己的劳苦，做工的果效也随着他们’（启14：13）。

[1] 华北浸会神学院是中国20世纪一所基督教神学院，由美南浸信会华北区联合会（山东与东北）主办。其前身为美南浸信会传教士海雅西、浦其维创办的卜氏神道学校，初设于登州，后迁至黄县小栾家疃。1931年，由于山东复兴的影响，卜氏神道学校改组为华北浸会神学院，以适应培养传道人的需要。院长柯理培。学生由10人左右增加到一百多人。1941年太平洋战争爆发后，柯理培等传教士被关进日军集中营，神学院停办。1946年，因受国共内战战事影响，华北浸会神学院无法恢复。院长柯理培等人赴上海，任中华浸会神学院校长。参https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E5%8D%8E%E5%8C%97%E6%B5%B8%E4%BC%9A%E7%A5%9E%E5%AD%A6%E9%99%A2。
