### “SCUBA”:

2024 Church Vocation Bible School

The church’s children ministry is particularly important. People have inherited original sin from Adam, and everyone has sin in their mother’s womb (Psalm 51:5). Augustine also said, “For in Thy sight none is pure from sin, not even the infant whose life is but a day upon the earth” (in The Confessions). Therefore, the sooner the child hears the gospel, the better, and it is best to start with their prenatal education.

Some countries or places in the world oppose letting children hear the gospel, and the motive behind it is clear, that is, to prevent sinful children from receiving the gospel. In the Old Testament, when the Israelites were in Egypt, the Egyptian Pharaoh, the representative of the evil forces, planned to strangle the Hebrew boys in the cradle, but the Lord kept them to become stronger day by day. Later, Pharaoh specifically prevented the strong men of Israel from not allowing children (note: there is no “women” in the original text) to serve the Lord with them (Exodus 10:10). Jesus loved children, and he commanded his disciples, “Suffer the little children to come to me, and do not forbid them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these” (KJV Matthew 19:14).

**Vacation Bible School (VBS) is a Christian education program for children held by local churches for about a week during the summer vacation, including songs and dances, faith courses, arts and crafts, and entertainment activities. VBS is a blessing in the lives of many people. Rev. Ron, who has been a missionary in Taiwan for more than 30 years, said: “I still remember vividly the Bible stories and missionary stories that my wife and I learned in VBS more than 70 years ago. They have always influenced our ministry.” A sister who works in Arkansas Baptist Children and Family Ministries said to me: “The decoration of your church VBS is so beautiful! It’s a pity that many churches have stopped doing VBS today. I accepted Jesus as my Savior when I attended VBS at the age of nine. I still remember when the counselor led me to pray for my decision.” I felt a little stressed about memorizing long lines of English stage plays to host VBS, a sister prayed for me, “Lord, please always be with Pastor Li and the team, so that they can fully experience your power and gifts.”**
It is our second VBS. The theme is: SCUBA (S: Self, C: Contained, U: Underwater, B: Breath, A: Apparatus), our Chinese translation is “Underwater Adventure.” It was held from 5:30 to 8:00 pm, June 18th to 21st. We had a great time. Three weeks ago, a couple drove for several hours to bring us the decoration materials from Highland Drive Baptist Church in Jonesboro. On the afternoon of June 16th, Father’s Day, the brothers and sisters used their skillful hands to decorate the church into the blue sea, bringing the children into the space of imagination.

Our church is a small church in Little Rock, our regular attendance is 60 to 80. However, out of the mercy and grace of the Lord, we are willing to do VBS to influence more children. At first, we were worried that many people would return home during the summer vacation and there would be a lack of students and volunteers. The Lord heard our prayers. During the four-day VBS, 32 children and youth volunteers registered, including a Chinese American mix-blooded child and three American children. There were 32 adult registered volunteers, responsible for promotion, connection, sound system, food, leading worship, teaching Bible stories, sharing missionary topics, planning Jonah play, photography, reception, and cleaning. Among them were two new believers, two gospel seekers, and a sister outside the state, who helped with making certificates. Each co-worker did a lot of work. During this period, we made connections with four gospel-seeking families. Three children decided to follow Jesus.

Every day we had a bible point, a verse memory, and a bible story. The first day’s bible point: God is a friend who is real, John 6:69, Bible story: Elijah (1 Kings 18-19); the second day’s point: God is a friend who we can trust, John 14:27, Bible story: Jesus calms the storm (Mark 4:35-41); the third point: God is a friend for everyone, John 3:16, Bible story: Lydia (Acts 16:11-15). The fourth day was a Family Fun Night: the children presented the “Jonah Play,” parents were invited to participate, the church issued certificates to the children and youth volunteers, and we took a big family picture.

The children were fond of the following sessions: A. Singing and dancing to worship the Lord. On the last day, all the children went on stage to worship the Lord. B. Watching a video of reciting scriptures with ocean stars as assistants. After watching the scriptures, the children were asked to recite the verse on the stage for a reward. Five children won rewards. One of the winners hung the Bible he received around his neck the next day. When the pastor asked the children, “If you plan to dive into the ocean, who would you invite to be your dive buddy?” He answered loudly, “God.” C. In the Imagination House, the children did handicrafts and experiments. They loved making heart shapes, candy canes and crosses by themselves, and doing scientific experiments to understand natural phenomena. D. In the Mission House, on the first day, they heard one co-worker from the Arkansas Baptist Children and Family Ministries introduce the foster care ministry. The cartoon story showed that the adopted children sang “I feel safe”. It was very touching. On the second day, Rev. Ron shared the story of Hudson Taylor’s missionary work in China. On the third day, a Christian anesthesiologist and her husband used a puppet to perform the process of anesthesia during surgery. This year’s offering project raised $231 for the Brazil Amazon River Mission, and the children took out some small coins to express their love.

The Lord Jesus said, “And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward” (Matthew 10:42). The Lord expects us to “give one of these little ones a cup of cold water to drink.” This cup of cold water is not only a material supply, but also a spiritual supply. The church VBS is giving a cup of cold water to the children, so that the living water of the gospel can be supplied to their young hearts. May the Lord strengthen the work of our hands! May VBS do better in 2025! May this sharing inspire more churches to do children ministry! In the name of Christ, Amen.

“海底探险”

——2024年教会暑期圣经学校

教会的儿童事工尤为重要。人有从亚当那里遗传来的原罪，每个人在母腹中就有了罪（诗51: 5）。奥古斯丁也说，“因为在你眼中，没有人是无罪的，即使是在地球上只活了一天的婴儿”（《忏悔录》中语）。故此，让孩子领受福音越早越好，最好从胎教开始。

有些地方反对让孩子听福音，其背后的动机很清楚，即拦阻有罪的孩子得到福音。旧约中以色列人在埃及时，埃及的法老——邪恶势力的代表计划将希伯来人的男孩扼杀在摇篮里，然而主却保守他们日渐强盛起来。后来，法老特别阻止以色列壮年人不允许孩子（注：原文中没有“妇女”一词）与他们同去事奉耶和华（出10: 10）。耶稣爱小孩子，他吩咐门徒说：“让小孩子到我这里来，不要禁止他们；因为在天国的，正是这样的人”（太19: 14）。

暑期圣经学校（Vacation Bible School，简称VBS）是暑假期间，当地教会为儿童举办为期一周左右的基督教育项目，包括诗歌舞蹈、信仰课程、艺术和手工艺以及娱乐活动。VBS是多人生命中的祝福。曾在台湾作过30多年宣教士的魏牧师说：“记得七十多年前我和师母在VBS学习的圣经故事、传教士故事，直到如今还记忆犹新，一直影响着我们的事奉”。一位在阿肯色浸信会儿童家庭事工（Arkansas Baptist Children and Family Ministries）工作的姐妹对我说：“你们教会VBS布置得太漂亮了！很可惜今天有许多教会停止作VBS。我在九岁时参加VBS时接受耶稣作救主。我仍记得当时辅导员带领我作决志祷告时的情景”。当我为主持VBS需要背大段英文舞台剧的台词感到有些压力时，一位姐妹为我祷告说：“主啊，求你一直与李牧师和团队同在，让他们完全经历你的大能和恩赐。”

今年是我们教会第二次举行VBS。主题是：SCUBA (S: Self, C: Contained, U: Underwater, B: Breath, A: Apparatus) ，中文翻译： “海底探险” 。从6月18日到21日晚5:30到8:00。在过去一周中，我们度过了美好的时光。三周前，一对夫妇开几个小时车将琼斯博罗高地大道浸信会教会（Highland Drive Baptist Church in Jonesboro）的布置材料带给我们。在6月16日父亲节下午，弟兄姐妹用灵巧的双手将教会布置成蔚蓝色的大海，让小朋友们进入想象的空间。

我们教会在小石城属于一间小型教会，平常有60-80人固定参加聚会。然而出于主的怜悯和恩典，我们愿意作VBS影响更多孩子。开始我们担心很多人暑期回国会缺少学生和义工。然而，主垂听我们的祷告。此次VBS有32位小朋友和青少年志愿者注册，包括一位中美混血小朋友和三位美国小朋友。成人注册义工有32位，负责宣传、联络、音响、食物、带敬拜、教圣经故事、分享宣教主题、排约拿剧、摄影、接待、清洁等，其中包括两位刚信主的弟兄姐妹、两位慕道朋友，还有一位搬到外州的姐妹帮忙制作毕业证书和青少年志愿者证书。每位同工都做了大量工作。在此期间，教会弟兄姐妹有机会与四个慕道家庭的家长建立连接。有三位小朋友决志愿意信耶稣。

四天中，每天有不同的圣经要点、背诵经文和圣经故事。第一天的要点：上帝是一位真实的朋友，经文：《约》6: 69，圣经故事：以利亚（王上18-19）；第二天要点：上帝是一位值得信靠的朋友，经文：《约》14: 27，圣经故事：耶稣平静风暴（可4: 35-41）；第三天要点：上帝是每个人的朋友，经文：《约》3: 16，圣经故事：吕底亚（徒16: 11-15）。第四天是家庭同乐夜，孩子们表演了约拿剧，家长们受邀来参加，教会为小朋友和青少年义工颁发证书，大家照全家福合影。

小朋友特别喜欢的几个环节包括A. 唱诗作律动敬拜主，最后一天所有小朋友都上台敬拜主。B. 观看以海洋明星为助手的背诵经文视频 ，看完经文后请小朋友们现场背诵经文领取奖品，四天里有五位小朋友获奖。有一位获奖的小朋友第二天就将得到的圣经挂在脖子上。当牧师问：“如果你们有机会到海洋探险，你会邀请谁作你的潜水伙伴呢”？他大声回答：“我请上帝作我的潜水伙伴”。C. 在联想房间(Imagination House) 小朋友们作手工和实验。他们很喜欢亲手编制的心形、糖果手杖和十字架，以及作科学实验了解自然现象。D. 在宣教房间里（Mission House），第一天听到阿肯色浸信会儿童和家庭事工的同工介绍寄养儿童事工（Foster Care Ministry），同工播放的卡通故事里被领养的孩子唱到“我感到安全”的那一幕很感人。第二天，魏荣恩牧师为孩子们介绍传教士戴德生去中国传教的故事。第三天，一位基督徒麻醉师和她丈夫用小木偶演绎给人作手术用麻醉剂的过程。今年的奉献项目为“巴西亚马逊河宣教项目”(Brazil Amazon River Mission Project)筹集了$ 231美金，孩子们将两个小钱拿出来表达爱心。

主耶稣说：“无论何人，因为门徒的名，只把一杯凉水给这小子里的一个喝，我实在告诉你们：这人不能不得赏赐（太10: 42）。主期待我们可以 “把一杯凉水给小子里的一个喝”。这杯凉水不仅是物质层面的供应，更是灵性层面的供应。教会VBS正是在将一杯凉水给孩子们喝，使福音的活水供应他们幼小的心田。愿主坚立我们手所作之工！愿2025年VBS能做得更好！愿此文分享能激励更多教会去作儿童事工！以基督之名，阿门。

周一到周五早5：00，周六早6：00。每次一个小时。周日没有。由弟兄姐妹轮流带领，欢迎弟兄姐妹参加。Zoom ID:501.501.7777,密码:777。
