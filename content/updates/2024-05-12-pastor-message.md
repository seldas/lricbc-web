Mothers’ Teachings

Prov 1: 8 Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction, and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.

**Pastor’s Word**
The Teachings of Mothers

Proverbs 1:8 “Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction, and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.”

Three mothers in my life have greatly influenced me. The first is my biological mother, Xu Yuanling; the second is my American teacher, Faye Pearson; and the third is Jane Brooking, with whom I once lived. These remarkable women each taught me lessons of sacrifice, wisdom, and love.

Let me first share about my own biological mother’s sacrifice. “Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne? Though she may forget, I will not forget you” (Isaiah 49:15). I am grateful to our Heavenly Father for giving me a sacrificial mother. When I was born, I suffered from severe congenital heart disease. The barefoot doctor (meaning a layperson trained to provide basic healthcare services, especially in rural areas of China) in our rural hometown suggested my parents abandon me on Mount Yuanbao where we lived. Like Moses’ mother, my mother chose to keep me. Although I have two siblings, my mother gave me most of her love. She dedicated herself to raising me into adulthood. My mother never had any formal education; she couldn’t even spell her own name correctly. Yet, she lived out the meaning of sacrifice or hardworking with all her life. When my father passed away from liver cancer at the age of 50, my mother single-handedly held our family together with her strong arms. The poverty of the rural environment cultivated her character of hard work, frugality, and endurance. She never stopped working. Blessed by the Lord, at 74 years old, she still has sharp hearing and clear vision, tirelessly dedicating herself to our family. Her steamed buns and dumplings are favorites of the whole family. She carries her two-and-a-half-year-old grandson on her back everywhere. She tends to the family vegetable garden from dawn till dusk, and her hard work always brings her the joy of a bountiful harvest. Not only can the various vegetables feed our own family, but there’s also enough left to share with brothers and sisters in the church. Her rule of sacrifice is a treasure.

**Faye Pearson (May 14, 1940 – February 20, 2019, refers to 5/14/2023 牧者之言 Pastor’s word) was an American missionary who served in Asia for 42 years. She remained single throughout her life, wholeheartedly devoted to the Lord. I feel honored to call her “Mom” because her exemplary character earned her that title, and many of her students affectionately called her mom as well. I met her at Nanjing Union Theological Seminary. Her rule was wisdom. Although she was American, her mindset was Chinese. She loved China and dedicated her life to spreading the Gospel to the Chinese people. When she passed away, she was wearing a traditional red Chinese Tang suit. She said, “If God gives me another forty years, I will continue to serve the Chinese people.” She cared about her students’ spirituality, families, and lives, even worrying about finding partners for older students. She was an excellent listener, someone you could talk to about anything. She also freely gave advice and guidance. She was a great leader, serving as the Regional Director for Asia at the International Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention, leading over five hundred missionary couples. Her leadership style was natural; she led by example rather than by power. She valued relationships and cared for everyone. She was a doer, organized and efficient. Even in her later years when she had cancer, she still welcomed many guests into her home and personally cooked for them. Before she passed away, she had already planned her memorial service and funeral, deciding where it would be held, who would preside, who would share testimonies, and what they would share. After I came to the United States in 2008, I visited her home every Christmas. I remember spending the last Christmas with her in 2018, where she still imparted wisdom to me and my wife on how to be a pastor and a pastor’s wife. When she saw that my eldest son Tianyi, at the age of two, was still unsteady on his feet, she specifically instructed us, “Tianyi has a slow temperament, so you must be patient with him. Don't rush him or force him to do things he doesn't want to do.” This advice still holds true today.**

**Mentioning my American mom Jane (refers to 5/15/22 牧者之言 Pastor’s Word) reminds me of an ancient Chinese saying: “Gratitude for a drop of water should be returned with a gushing spring.” During my last year of study in the United States, she and my American dad Leslie welcomed me to stay in their home for six months free of charge. They fed me when I was hungry, gave me water when I was thirsty, welcomed me as a guest (Matthew 25:35), drove me to school when I was studying, took my suit to the dry cleaner when I graduated, acted as my parents at my wedding, and sent little gifts when my children were born... Her teaching was love. Although she didn’t have children of her own, she hosted several students in her home over the years. These students affectionately called her “Mom.” Anyone who met her will never forget her sweet smile and warm hugs. As I mentioned before, when she met someone, she would give them a big hug, holding them tight for a long time, at least 20 seconds. When she passed away, a Chinese student left a message on her Facebook page: “You are the most kind-hearted friend we’ve ever had. I’m so glad that we met you and spent time with you. I will always remember your smile and warm heart. Rest In Peace.” Her love came from the Lord, “Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God” (1 John 4:7). This love is broad, warm-hearted, and can give people strength.**
The teachings of these three mothers: sacrifice, wisdom, and love, I will keep in mind and continue to learn from them.

On Mother's Day, may the Lord bless every mother with health, peace, and joy!

母亲们的法则

### 箴 1：8 我儿，要听你父亲的训诲，不可离弃你母亲的法则。

箴言1：8中的 “法则” 原文“תּוֹרָה”（torah）和“律法”（law）是同一个词，有“方向、教导”等意思。“母亲的法则”这个表达让我想到“家训”或“传家宝”等概念。每个母亲都有她的人生法则，这些法则是儿女们的家训和传家宝，值得继承和发扬。

我生命中的三位母亲对我产生了很大影响。第一位是我的亲生母亲徐元玲；第二位是我的美籍老师裴斐（Faye Pearson）妈妈；第三位是我曾经寄居在她家的简·布鲁金（Jane Brooking）妈妈。这三位了不起的女性分别教导了我舍己、智慧和愛心的法则。

我先分享一下自己亲生母亲的舍己。“妇人焉能忘记她吃奶的婴孩，不怜恤她所生的儿子？即或有忘记的，我却不忘记你”（赛49：15）。感谢天父赐予我一位舍己的母亲。我出生时患有严重的先天性心脏病。农村老家的赤脚医生建议我父母把我扔到元宝山上去。我的母亲像摩西的母亲一样，将我留了下来。我有姐弟三人，但母亲却将她大部分的爱给了我。她倾其全力将我抚养成人。母亲没有读过书，她甚至无法拼写出自己的名字来；然而她用全部的生命实践着舍己的意义。父亲50岁那年得肝癌去世，母亲独自用她坚强的膀臂撑起了这个家。农村贫穷的环境造就了母亲吃苦耐劳、勤俭节约的品格。她从未停止过劳动。蒙主眷顾，她今年74岁耳不聋、眼不花，仍在坚持不懈地为我家付出。她蒸的包子和饺子是全家人的最爱。她背着两岁半的孙子到处走。她起早贪黑亲生耕种家里的菜园，辛勤的耕耘总是给她带来丰收的喜悦，各样蔬菜不仅可以供自己家里吃，还可有余分给弟兄姐妹们。她舍己的法则是一笔财富。

**裴斐（Faye Pearson，1940年5月14日—2019年2月20日，参5/14/2023 牧者之言 Pastor’s word）妈妈是一位美国传教士，她在亚洲宣教42年。她一生单身，衷心服侍主。我之所有称她为“妈妈”是因为她的美好品行赢得了这个称号，并且她教导过的许多学生都亲切地称呼她妈妈。我在南京神学院认识她。她的法则是智慧。她是美国人，可思维模式却是中国式的。她热爱中国，将她的一生奉献给向中国人传道的福音事工上，她去世时穿着一身红色的唐装。她说：“如果上帝再加增我四十年，我还要服侍中国人”。 她关心学生的灵性、家庭和生活，甚至操心帮大龄学生们找对象。她是一位很好的倾听者，你可以和她无话不谈；她也可以毫无保留地给予意见和指导。她是一位大领袖，曾在美南浸信会国际宣教部担任驻亚洲区总干事，带领五百多对传教士夫妇。她的领袖风格是天然的；她用榜样而不是用权力去带领。她重视人际关系，关心每个人。她是个实干家，做事有计划有条理，干净利落。她晚年身患癌症时，仍然在家里接待许多客人，并亲手下厨为客人们准备食物。她去世前提前就将自己的追思礼和安葬礼安排好，确定在哪里举行，谁主持，谁分享见证、该分享什么等。2008年我来美国之后，每逢圣诞节都会去她家里。记得2018年与她度过的最后一个圣诞节时，她依然以智慧教导我和莎莎如何作牧师、作师母。当她看到我大儿子天意2岁还走不稳时，特别嘱咐我们说：“天意是个慢性格的孩子，你们对他一定要有耐心。不要催他，不要逼他作他不愿意作的事。”这句话今日依然受用。**

**提到我的美国妈妈简（参5/15/22 牧者之言 Pastor’s Word）让我想到中国的一句古话：“受人滴水之恩当以涌泉相报”。在我来美留学最后一年，她和美国爸爸莱斯利（Leslie）接待我在她家免费住了半年时间。他们在我饿的时候给我吃，渴的时候给我喝，我作客旅留我住（太25：35），我上学时开车送我去学校，我毕业时帮我将西服带到干洗店去干洗，我婚礼上作我的父母，我孩子出生时寄来小礼物……。她的法则是爱心。她没有自己的孩子，却先后接待几位学生到她家里住。这些学生亲切地称呼她“妈妈”。凡接触过她的人永远忘不了她甜蜜的微笑和热情的拥抱。正如我从前所提到的，她与人见面时，会给对方一个大大的拥抱，抱得很紧，持续时间很长，至少有20秒钟。她去世时，一位中国留学生在她脸书上留言说：“你是我们遇到过的最善良的朋友。 我很高兴我们认识你并与你共度时光。 我会永远记住你的笑容和温暖的心。愿你安息。” 她的爱心是从主里来的，“凡有爱心的，都是由神而生，并且认识神”（约一4：7）。这份爱是宽广的，包容的，并且可以给人带去力量的。**

### 这三位母亲的法则：舍己、智慧和爱心，我将铭记在心，并仍在学习中。

母亲节愿主赐福每一位母亲健康、平安和喜乐！

In Proverbs 1:8, the word “法则” (“fǎlüè”) is translated as “teaching” or “instruction.” In Hebrew, it is the same word with “law”- “תּוֹרָה” (“torah”), meaning “direction” or “teaching.” The phrase “母亲的法则” (“mǔqīn de fǎlüè”) shares the same concept with “family rules” or “heirlooms of wisdom.” Every mother has her own rules of life, which serve as family traditions and treasures worth inheriting and promoting.

周一到周五早5：00，周六早6：00。每次一个小时。周日没有。由弟兄姐妹轮流带领，欢迎弟兄姐妹参加。Zoom ID:501.501.7777,密码:777。
