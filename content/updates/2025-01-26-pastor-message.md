**1/26/25 Pastor’s Word**
Spiritual Markers in our Lives

Elinda West

### Scripture: Psalm 77:11-14

Early Prayer meeting January 16, 2025

January 10th is the anniversary of my father’s death in 1982.  He was 55 years old.  This year and every year my sisters and I talk about daddy and what he and mother meant to us and how thankful we were to grow up in a Christian home! I’ve shared a little about this event before in Early Prayer meeting.  For all of us losing our parents is a significant time in our lives and a sad time. Wei Mushr and I left America the day after Father’s Day on June 17, 1979. There was a Commissioning Service at our home church for us to be sent out as missionaries to Taiwan.  Later, when it was time to say good-bye to my parents I gave daddy a Father’s Day card. In that card I shared with him that it was through his love that I realized what the love of God the Father must be like. I told him he had loved and cared for my needs and guided me and prayed for me as I grew up.

My parents always took me to church, and I professed my faith in Jesus and was baptized at 9 years old. I said more things in that Father’s Day card expressing my gratitude and love to my daddy and I told him my prayer was that my life might reflect the same love that he had shown to me!  It made my daddy weep. I had never seen my daddy cry until that day and I was 31 years old. It was good for my daddy to hear me say those feelings to him. He was proud of me but sad we were going away for a long time.

As I was thinking about my dad this past week I began to think about the “Spiritual Markers” we all have in our lives. They don’t happen often. These Spiritual memories are crucial in our Christian life. These times in our lives IDENTIFY A TIME we know God clearly GUIDED US by the power of the Holy Spirit or gave us a CLEAR CALL to service! SPIRITUAL MARKERS REMIND US OF THE POWER OF GOD!  THEY GIVE US CONFIDENCE TO FACE TODAY’S BATTLES (as we look back on how He led us in the past). THEY GIVE OUR CHILDREN CONFIDENCE TO FIGHT TOMORROW’S BATTLES! (as we share with them God’s work in our lives). THEY WITNESS TO THE MIGHTY HAND OF GOD! REMEMBERING WHAT GOD HAS DONE HELPS US GIVE HIM ALL THE GLORY!  We go away from these experiences as a stronger and better person than we were before.  We might not feel stronger immediately after the event or season, but with the passing of time we look back and see that God used it in our lives to strengthen our faith and trust in Him AND FOR THAT WE PRAISE HIM!

Wei Mushr and I often share our Spiritual Markers with our children and grandchildren because we think it is important for us to do that. They need to hear these stories and be challenged to trust God themselves. We want them to see the value and blessing of walking closely with the Lord!  In the process of telling others about Spiritual Markers we ourselves receive confidence and courage for today and hope for the future! These markers have spiritual significance, like the Passover for the Israelites and The Lord’s Supper for us, Paul on the road to Damascus, Moses and the burning bush. Wei Mushr and I discussed that our own spiritual markers include our conviction of sin and salvation experience, our marriage, our call to missionary service and separation from everything and everyone we knew… to live in another country for 30 plus years.

We had been in Taiwan for only 2 1/2 years when my dad learned he had cancer and only lived 4 months after that. I could not return to the U.S. to support my mother and sisters and other close family members and attend the funeral.  We were attending a Chinese Church in Taiwan and the pastor wanted to hold a service for our family. They sang the song “Victory in Jesus” because it was sung at the service in America. They prepared a large portrait of daddy and had a cross of real flowers at the front of the church. The pastor preached from Genesis 12 where God told Abram to “leave your country, your people and your father’s household and go to the land I will show you”... and he read on through verse 3… “and all the peoples on earth will be blessed through you.” I know he shared many words to comfort me and all the people came one by one to take my hand and I saw their tears! They didn’t know my daddy at all but they loved our family and we had only been in that church 2 years. I was touched so deeply. Our missionary family also held a service for us. It brought us so close together to share this sadness, my grief. A stronger faith was established in my heart in those days and months. These loving brothers and sisters built up my faith by their love, their care, their own spiritual markers and their prayers…. as we walked and worked together in daily life… and time went on.

When we share our spiritual markers with each other we all are strengthened and have hope!  You know, even though I was so hurt that my daddy passed away so young I learned about trusting God no matter what. I had God’s wonderful peace and presence.  God is never unkind. He lavishes us with His love. His ways are higher than ours.  Maybe some of you remember another time in Early Morning Prayer I shared about my struggle with separation from my family in the early days of being a missionary.  The Lord showed me during this difficult grief and sadness He had prepared 2 other wonderful families for me in the place he called me to serve Him……My fellow Missionary Family and My Chinese Church family! I look back and am overwhelmed with His Faithfulness. In the same year daddy left us.. God gave Wei Mushr and I another son. We were so excited and grateful for God’s Goodness to us which He saved for that time in our life.

Here in Early Prayer today I’m sharing a Spiritual Marker in my life! What are your Spiritual Markers? Think about it!  We are FAMILY so let’s share together our lives, our prayers, our answers to prayers and be Blessed and Encouraged!!!

Dear Lord, help us to identify the spiritual markers in our lives and as we do that help us develop spiritual memory in our walk with you. As we remember these events in our lives help them to continue to strengthen our faith and keep us consistently on the path. Help us share with others so we can encourage each other. Thank you Father that you are constantly working in our lives and that these markers are reminders to us that we belong to You and our future is secure in You! Thank you Jesus for the Body of Christ ….Our Family! In Jesus’s Name Amen.

魏师母

我们生命中的属灵标记

### •    经文：诗篇77:11-14

### •    2025年1月16日晨祷会

1 月 10 日是我父亲的忌日，1982 年他去世了，享年 55 岁。今年和每年，我和姐妹们都会分享爸爸，分享他和妈妈对我们的意义，分享我们多么感激在一个基督徒家庭中长大！我以前在晨祷会上分享过一些这方面的事情。对我们所有人来说，失去父母是我们生命中意义重大的时刻，也是悲伤的时刻。1979 年 6 月 17 日，父亲节的第二天，我和魏牧师离开了美国。我们家乡的教会举行了一次差遣礼，我们将被差遣到台湾担任传教士。后来，当我要和父母道别的时候，我给了爸爸一张父亲节贺卡。在那张贺卡里，我告诉他，正是通过他的愛，我才意识到天父的愛是什么样的。我告诉他，在我成长的过程中，他一直愛着我、关心着我、引导着我，并为我祈祷。

我的父母总是带我去教会，我决志信靠耶稣，并在 9 岁时受浸礼。我在父亲节卡片上说了更多的话来表达我对爸爸的感激和愛。我告诉他我的祈祷是希望我的生命能反映出他对我的愛！这让我爸爸哭了。直到那天我 31 岁，我才第一次看到爸爸哭。听到我对他说出这些感受，爸爸很高兴。他为我感到骄傲，但也为我们即将离开很长一段时间而感到难过。

上周，当我想起我的父亲时，我开始思考我们生命中都有的“属灵标记” 。它们并不常见。这些属灵记忆在我们的基督徒生活中至关重要。我们生命中的这些时刻确定了我们知道上帝以圣灵的力量清楚地引导我们，或给我们一个明确的呼召服侍的时刻！属灵标记提醒我们上帝的力量！（当我们回顾他过去如何引导我们时），它们给我们信心去面对今天的争战。（当我们与孩子们分享上帝在我们生命中的工作时），它们给我们的孩子信心为明天争战！它们见证上帝大能的手！记住上帝所做的一切有助于我们将所有的荣耀归于他！我们从这些经历中走出来，成为一个比以前更强大、更好的人。我们可能不会在某个事件或某个阶段结束后立即感到更强大，但随着时间的流逝，我们回首往事，发现上帝在我们的生活中用它来加强我们对他的信仰和信任，为此我们赞美他！

我和魏牧师经常和我们的孩子和孙辈分享我们的属灵标记，因为我们认为这样做很重要。他们需要听到这些故事，并受到挑战，自己去信靠上帝。我们希望他们看到与主紧密同行的价值和祝福！在向他人讲述属灵标记的过程中，我们自己获得了对今天的信心和勇气以及对未来的盼望！这些标记具有属灵意义，就像以色列人的逾越节和我们的主餐礼、保罗在去大马色的路上、摩西和燃烧的荆棘。我和魏牧师分享过，我们自己的属灵标记包括我们对罪的认识和得救的经历、我们的婚姻、我们对传教服侍的呼召，以及我们与所认识的一切和每个人分离……在另一个国家生活 30 多年。

我们刚到台湾两年半时，我爸爸就得知自己得了癌症，之后他只活了四个月。我无法回到美国支持我的母亲、姐妹和其他亲人、以及参加葬礼。我们当时正在台湾参加一个中国教会，牧师想为我们一家举行一场礼拜。他们唱了“耶稣的胜利”这首歌，因为在美国的礼拜仪式上唱过这首歌。他们准备了一幅爸爸的大画像，并在教堂前面放了一个用真花制成的十字架。牧师以《创世纪》第 12 章讲道，上帝告诉亚伯兰“离开本地，本族和父家，往我要指示你的地去”…… 他继续读到第 3 节…… “地上的万族都要因你得福。”我知道他讲了很多话来安慰我，所有人都一个接一个地来握住我的手，我看到了他们的眼泪！他们根本不认识我的父亲，但他们愛我们一家人，我们只在那间教会待了两年。我深受感动。我们的传教士家庭也为我们举行了一场礼拜。它让我们如此亲密地聚在一起，分享这份悲伤，我的悲痛。在那些日子和几个月里，我心中建立了更坚定的信心。这些可愛的弟兄姐妹们用他们的愛心、他们的关怀、他们自己的属灵标志和他们的祈祷建立了我的信心……我们在日常生活中一起前行和工作……时间就这样流逝着。

当我们彼此分享属灵标记时，我们都会得到坚固并充满盼望！你知道，尽管我很伤心我的父亲去世得很早，但我学会了无论发生什么都要信靠上帝。我拥有上帝奇妙的平安和同在。上帝从不无情。他用他的愛厚待我们。他的道路比我们的道路更高。也许你们中的一些人还记得在另一次晨祷中我分享了我在成为传教士初期与家人分离的挣扎。在这种艰难的悲痛和伤心中，主告诉我，在他呼召侍奉他的地方他为我准备了另外两个美好的家庭……我的传教士同胞家庭和我的中国教会家庭！回首往事，我被他的信实所折服。在爸爸离开我们的同一年，上帝赐给我和魏牧师另一个儿子。我们非常激动，并感谢上帝对我们的仁慈，他在我们生命中的那段时间拯救了我们。

今天在晨祷中，我分享了我生命中的一个属灵标记！你的属灵标记是什么？想一想！我们是一家人，所以让我们一起分享我们的生活、我们的祷告、主对我们祷告的回应，并得到祝福和鼓励！！！

亲愛的上帝，请帮助我们识别我们生命中的属灵标记，这样，在我们这样做的同时，请帮助我们在与你同行的过程中建立属灵的记忆。当我们记住生活中的这些事件帮助我们持续增强我们的信心，并让我们持续走在正路上。帮助我们与他人分享，以便我们相互鼓励。谢谢天父，你一直在我们生命中工作，这些标记提醒我们，我们属于你，我们的未来在你那里是安全的！谢谢耶稣赐予我们基督的身体……我们的教会大家庭！ 奉耶稣的名，阿门。
