Practicing Gratitude, Part 5

### Scripture Reading: Philippians 4:8-9

If you practice gratitude every day, what do you think the result will be?

The Bible promises that seeing the good in daily life leads to peace.

“If there is any excellence and if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. Keep on doing the things that you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, and the God of peace will be with you.” (Philippians 4:8–9).

Medical studies confirm the link between gratitude and mental health. When test subjects wrote down three good things (Seligman et al., 2005), kept a gratitude journal (Kerr, O’Donovan, &amp; Pepping, 2014), or wrote letters of gratitude to other people (Toepfer et al., 2012) all demonstrated improvements in levels of anxiety, depression, and life satisfaction.

The Bible and the scientific material both attest to the effectiveness of simple gratitude practices. If you want to deepen your level of peace and your relationship with God, gratitude is a great place to start.

### Practice:

Reflect on the past week. Which practice of gratitude gave you the most peace? Was it noticing something good three times a day? Finding gratitude in something hard? Thanking another person? Replacing the urge to compare with gratitude for what you have right now?

Whichever discipline most helped you to experience gratitude, make that your practice today.

Make a plan for the future: How can you build a practice of gratitude into your daily life?

Prayer: God, thank you for all that you’ve given me. Please give me a grateful heart and a deeper relationship with you. Grant me peace today. Amen.

操练感恩五

### 阅读经文：腓立比书 4:8-9

如果你每天都操练感恩，你认为结果会是什么？

圣经应许，看见日常生活中的美好会带来平安。

“若有什么德行，若有什么称赞，这些事你们都要思念。你们在我身上所学习的、所领受的、所听见的、所看见的，这些事你们都要去行，赐平安的神就必与你们同在。”

### （腓立比书 4:8-9）

医学研究也证实了感恩与心理健康之间的联系。当受试者每天写下三件好事（Seligman 等人，2005年）、保持感恩日记（Kerr, O’Donovan 和 Pepping, 2014年），或写感恩信给他人（Toepfer 等人，2012年），他们的焦虑、抑郁以及生活满意度都有所改善。

圣经和科学研究都证明，简单的感恩操练很有效。如果你想加深内心的平安和与神的关系，感恩是一个很好的起点。

### 操练：

回想过去一周，哪种感恩操练最能带给你平安？是每天觉察三件好事？是在困境中找到感恩？是感谢他人？还是用感恩取代比较？

无论哪种方式最有效，今天就开始操练吧。

### 制定未来计划：你如何将感恩操练融入日常生活？

### 祷告：

神啊，感谢祢赐给我的一切。请赐我一颗感恩的心，并让我与祢建立更深的关系。今日求祢赐我平安。阿们。
