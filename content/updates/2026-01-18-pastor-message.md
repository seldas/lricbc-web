Our Church’s Vision

---
**1/18/26 Pastor’s Word**
“Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint” (Prov. 29: 18, NIV)

“Where there is no vision, the people are unrestrained”(perish in KJV) (Prov. 29: 18, NASB)

“I will pour forth My Spirit upon all mankind; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams” (Acts 2: 17, NASB).

January 11, 2026 – First Seeking Building Prayer Meeting

On January 11, 2026, our church held its first prayer meeting for seeking a church building. During the meeting, many brothers and sisters expressed that the concepts of “vision,” “our church’s vision,” and “our church’s current stage of vision” were somewhat unclear. Here, the pastor attempts to answer these questions.

1. Our Vision

a. Definition of “Vision”

According to the “Basic Training for Church Planters” published in 2003 by the North American Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention (NAMB), in the context of Christian discipleship and church growth, “vision” is not a humanly devised plan. Rather, it is a Spirit‑inspired direction given by God and a spiritual discernment of God’s will for His church. Church leaders must seek God in continual and focused prayer, waiting on Him to reveal His intentions for the congregation. From this perspective, vision is a promise of what is to come and a representation of God’s divine intention—showing what God desires the church to become and accomplish. It is also a clear and challenging picture of the future that church leaders deeply believe the church “can and must” achieve under God’s leading.

b. Characteristics of Vision

In church growth, vision is a God‑given tool that guides the church toward its future. A biblical and life‑filled vision normally has the following ten characteristics:

It comes from God’s redemptive purpose. It is grounded in the Great Commission, responding to God’s desire to bless and use His people in visible ministries and acts of obedience.

It focuses on the future. It goes beyond present limitations and leads the church toward what God has prepared.

It communicates through clear images. It is not abstract language, but a future picture that can be imagined, understood, and embraced.

It motivates and mobilizes believers for ministry. It attracts people to participate in God’s work and encourages cooperation and shared mission.

It evokes genuine and enduring commitment. It inspires believers to willingly offer their time, gifts, resources, and lives.

It promotes unity within the church. It aligns hearts and efforts so that all move toward the same goal.

It reflects the distinct calling of this local church. It clearly shows how this specific congregation is to fulfill God’s purposes in its context.

It focuses on key priorities. It helps the church discern what matters most and directs energy toward core mission.

It empowers the church with faith and confidence. It strengthens faith and releases spiritual momentum for forward movement under the Holy Spirit.

It builds up the church. A strong vision gives the church vitality and enables it to shine continuously as a lampstand for the Lord.

c. Evaluating Vision

Five questions to test whether a vision is genuine:

Does this vision glorify God?

Does it promote faith rather than fear?

Does it motivate people to do action?

Does it require stepping out by faith and taking risks?

Is it right for this time, place, and people?

d. The Vision of Little Rock Immanuel Chinese Baptist Church

On our church website, we state the church’s grand vision:

“But we will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on us; we will be the Lord’s witnesses in Little Rock, and in Arkansas and the United States, and to the world!” (Acts 1:8)

The church’s current vision is: to find our own place of worship — a church building.

To clarify two concepts: “church” and “church building” are related but different. The Greek word church (ἐκκλησία) refers to the assembly of believers. Church building is the physical place where the church meets. Church construction involves two aspects: Internal building — spiritual growth, prayer, Bible reading, and establishing a relationship with God;

External building — corporate worship, fellowship life, and having a fixed meeting place.

Internal is the foundation; external is the expression. They are complementary, not contradictory. Without internal building, external structure is an empty shell; without external building, internal life is limited in influence and can easily become hollow words. In seeking and establishing a church building, we not only build outwardly but also experience God’s mighty power and taste the blessings and joy of Emmanuel — God with us.

**2. The Pastor’s Received Vision**

---
**Pastor Chunhai Li was called by the Lord to serve at Little Rock Immanuel Chinese Baptist Church in June 2018. After undergoing open‑heart surgery in 2020, he earnestly sought God for guidance concerning the church’s future. On April 21, during prayer, the Lord gave him a clear and ongoing burden under the theme:**
“Tell Our Children — Impact the Next Generation.”

### Specific content:

“As Chinese Christians living in America, we must tell our children: we need a church building that truly belongs to God and also belongs to us. One day, we can gratefully tell our children: your parents once united in heart and, by God’s grace, built this church. Today, our generation of believers, relying on faith and courage and the wisdom God provides, must unite with one another, diligently proclaim the gospel, rescue souls, serve others, give back to society, impact the community, and even change the world.

We firmly believe that one day, our children will look to their parents’ faith and courage as an example. In their future studies, careers, and life journeys, they will continue to rely on God, boldly stepping into the land He has promised and entering the open skies God has prepared for them. May the world be different because of them!”

### This vision has several confirmations:

### First — God’s Word:

In July 2020, God reinforced the vision through Scripture. Haggai 1:7–8 says:

“This is what the LORD Almighty says: ‘Give careful thought to your ways. Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build the house, and I will take pleasure in it and be honored,’” affirming the call to build.

Second — Confirmation from fellow pastors and coworkers:

---
**On April 22, 2020, the pastor shared this burden with pastors Don Challenor, Marker Carter (from the mother church IBC), and Pastor Rone Wei, and all affirmed it positively.**

---
**On April 27, Pastor Li shared this vision with Paul and Vivian, who responded: “Thanks be to God. When the church was established over a decade ago, our goal was for the church to become an autonomous Southern Baptist church.”**

---
**Third — Encouragement from a Respectful Chinese Pastor:**

---
**On September 22, 2019, veteran Chinese Rev. Peter Leong preached at our church. The next morning, on the way to the airport, Pastor Li asked him: “What should our church’s expectation be?” He replied, “Your church should have your own church building. Only then can you have greater impact on the community and more effectively expand the work of God’s kingdom.”**

---
**On December 29, 2020, Pastor Li received a Christmas letter from Pastor Leong:**
“I pray to the Lord for you, asking for wisdom and strength to lead His people in unity to build the Lord’s church and spread the gospel. We can rest assured — God is in control of all things, and He has a specific plan for you and me to fulfill in God’s timing. He promises never to leave us or forsake us.”

God, through His faithful servant, seemed to say: “The time has come — it is time to act!”

Fourth — A coworker’s COVID test result:

At that time, one coworker was suspected of having COVID. The pastor prayed for a sign: if the test was positive, that Sunday’s worship would move online and he would not share the building vision. The Lord heard the prayer — the test was negative, in‑person worship proceeded, and the vision was shared as planned.

### Fifth — The need in Little Rock:

Little Rock is the capital of Arkansas. The estimated Chinese population is already over a thousand, yet the city still has no Chinese church building. As a church blessed by God, our LRICBC should take up this mission that benefits this generation and the next, responding to a real and urgent need in the city.

3. Our Church History and Current Reality

Little Rock Immanuel Chinese Baptist Church began in 1990 as a family and student Bible study. In 1993, the group met at Immanuel Baptist Church; in 1998, it officially became a mission church of IBC. In 2003, five brothers and sisters restarted Sunday School; in 2004, Sunday worship resumed with various guest speakers. On November 14, 2021, the church formally became an autonomous congregation, named “Little Rock Immanuel Chinese Baptist Church.” On July 3, 2022, the church moved its worship to the Fellowship Hall of Markham Street Baptist Church.

---
**During that week’s Pastor’s Word (“A Shelter for the Young”; Psalm 83:4), it was noted that Markham Street Baptist Church had given its original church building to The Arkansas Baptist Children’s Home and Family Ministries, and we currently pay $2,000 per month for our meeting space. This is a temporary location — a “ride‑the‑donkey while seeking the horse” situation — but it also provides opportunities for church growth and training, equipping brothers and sisters in teaching, evangelism, service, stewardship, and children and youth ministries.**
According to the January 11, 2026 members’ meeting report, the church has 94 members (78 active, 16 inactive) and about $XX is realistically available for a building.

When a coworker asked, “Is having our own church building truly a God‑given vision?”

---
**Pastor Li replied unequivocally: “Yes — 100% sure.”**
Another asked, “Do you think we are ready?” He answered: “Yes, absolutely.”

---
**Pastor Li and many prayer warriors have long prepared for this in prayer. He asks God to make this vision clear to all brothers and sisters and to stir every heart to willingly serve, because “no one person can fulfill the Great Commission alone.” When the Lord sees His children passionately acting for His work, how joyful His heart must be!**
Lord, guide us to continue walking in Your ways! Amen!

### “没有异象，民就放肆；唯遵守律法的，便为有福。” （箴 29:18，NIV）

### “没有异象，民就放纵；遵守律法的，必为有福。” （箴 29:18，NASB）

### “没有异象，民就灭亡。” （箴言 29:18，KJV）

“我要将我的灵浇灌凡有血气的；你们的儿女要说预言，你们的少年人要见异象，你们的老年人要作异梦。” （徒2：17）

2026年1月11年教会召开第一次寻堂祷告会。会上，弟兄姐妹对“异象”、“我们教会的异象”以及“我们教会现阶段的异象”这些概念比较模糊。在此，牧者尝试回答这些问题。

1.    我们的异象

a.    “异象”的定义

根据美南浸信会北美国内宣教部（North American Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention）2003年出版的《植堂人基础培训》（Basic Training for Church Planters）中指出：

在基督徒门训与教会成长的处境中，“异象”不是人凭自己构想出来的计划，而是圣灵所感动、上帝所赐下的方向，是对上帝旨意的属灵分辨。教会领袖需要借着持续、专一的祷告寻求神，等候祂启示祂对教会的心意。从这个角度看，异象是一种对将来之事的应许，是上帝神圣旨意的形象化表达，展现祂期望教会成为什么、并完成什么使命；同时，它也是一幅清楚而具挑战性的未来图画，是教会领袖深信教会“可以、也必须”在神的带领下实现的方向（17）。

b.    异象的特征

根据这本书的介绍，在教会发展中，异象是上帝赐下、引导教会走向祂未来的重要工具。一个合乎圣经、充满生命力的异象，通常具备以下十个特征：

第一，源于上帝的救赎旨意。以大使命为根基，回应上帝赐福并使用祂百姓的心意，并在具体可见的事工与顺服行动中体现出来。

第二，指向未来。超越当下的限制，引导教会看见并迈向上帝所预备的将来。

第三，以清晰的图像表达。不是抽象口号，而是可想象、可理解、可认同的未来画面。

第四，激励并动员信徒参与事奉。吸引人投入上帝的工作，推动同工合作与共同承担使命。

第五，唤起真实而持久的委身。激发信徒甘心献上时间、恩赐、资源与生命。

第六，促进教会合一。同一心灵、同一脚踪，凝聚人心，使全体朝着共同目标前行。

第七，体现本教会独特的呼召。清楚表明这间教会在特定处境中如何完成上帝托付的使命。

第八，聚焦关键优先次序。帮助教会分辨“最重要的事”，集中力量在核心使命上。

第九，赋予能力与信心。坚固信心，经历属灵动力，使教会在圣灵引导下勇敢前进。

第十，异象坚固教会。它使教会更具生命力，并作为金灯台不断为主发光。

c.    衡量异象

### 检验异象的五个问题：

1.    这个异象是否荣耀上帝？

2.    它是否激发信心，而不是造成惧怕？

3.    它是否能推动人采取实际行动？

4.    它是否需要凭信心迈出脚步、承担风险？

5.    这个异象是否适合当前的时间、地点和这群人？

d.    小石城以马内利华语浸信会的异象

### 我们教会的网站上陈述教会的大异象：

“但圣灵降临在我们身上，我们就必得着能力，并要在小石城，阿肯色州，全美国，直到世界各地，作主的见证！”

### 教会当前的异象是：找到自己的聚会场所——教堂。

澄清两个概念：“教会”和“教堂”是相关却不同的。希腊文中的 church（ἐκκλησία）指的是信徒的聚会或团契，而教堂则是教会聚会的实体场所。教会的建造包括两方面：一是内在建造，指生命成长、祷告读经、与神建立关系；二是外在建造，指集体敬拜、团契生活以及拥有固定聚会场所。内在是基础，外在是表现，两者相辅相成，并不矛盾。没有内在，外在只是空架子；没有外在，内在也难以发挥影响，容易流于口号。在寻找和建立教堂的过程中，我们不仅建造外在，也正好经历神大能的彰显，品尝以马内利神与我们同在的祝福与喜乐。

2.    牧者领受异象

---
**李春海牧师于2018年6月蒙主呼召来到小石城以马内利华语浸信会服侍。2020 年刚做了开胸手术后，他迫切求告上帝，寻求祂对教会未来方向的指引。4 月 21 日，在祷告中，主给了一个清楚和持续的感动，题目是： “告诉孩子们：影响下一代”（ “Tell Our Children — Impact the Next Generation”）。**

### 具体内容：

“作为在美的华人基督徒，我们要告诉我们的孩子们：我们需要上帝赐给我们一间真正属于祂、也属于我们的教堂。有一天我们可以感恩地对我们的孩子们说：你们的父辈曾同心合意，靠着上帝的恩典建立教会。今天，我们这一代信徒，当凭着信心与勇气，倚靠上帝所赐的智慧和聪明，彼此联结，竭力传福音、抢救灵魂，服事众人、回馈社会，影响社区，甚至改变世界。

我们深信有一天，我们的孩子会以父辈的信心与勇气为榜样，在他们未来的学习、事业和人生道路上，继续倚靠上帝，勇敢地迈向祂所应许之地，进入上帝为他们预备的一片蓝天。愿世界因他们而不同！”

### 这份异象有以下几个印证：

第一，主的话语

2020 年 7 月，主借着祂的话坚固异象。《哈该书》1:7–8 说：“万军之耶和华如此说：你们要省察自己的行为。你们要上山取木料，建造这殿，我就因此喜乐，且得荣耀。”

第二，牧者与同工的印证

2020年4月22日，牧者将这份感动分别与Don Challenor 牧师、以马内利浸信会母会的Marker Carter牧师、以及魏荣恩牧师分享时，他们对这份异象都予以积极的肯定。

2020年4月27日李牧师与Paul和Vivian分享这个异象。他们说：“感谢主。当十几年前教会成立之初，我们设立的目标就是教会要成为一个自立的美南浸信会教会”。

第三， 华人牧者的鼓励

华人资深牧者梁德舜牧师在 2019 年 9 月 22 日 来我们教会讲道。次日清晨送梁牧师去机场时，李牧师请教他：“我们教会的期待应当是什么？”他回答说：“你们的教会应当有自己的教堂。只有这样，才能对社区产生更大的影响，并更广泛地拓展神国的事工。”

2020年12月29日李牧师收到梁牧师寄给的圣诞信，上面说：“我向主为你祈祷智慧、能力带领祂的子民同心努力建立主的教会，广传福音。我们可以完全放心，上帝掌管一切，并且祂有一个特定计划，要你、我按时完成。祂应许永远不会离开我们或抛弃我们。”上帝借着他的老仆人在说话：“时候到了，是该采取行动了”！

第四，同工新冠测试结果

当时有一位同工疑似感染新冠。牧者向神祷告，求一个凭据：若检测结果为阳性，当主日崇拜将改为线上进行，他也不会分享建堂的异象。结果主垂听祷告，检测结果为阴性，现场崇拜照常举行，建堂的异象也得以在当日分享。

第五，小石城的需要

小石城是阿肯色州的州府，华人人口估计已有上千人，但在整个城市中，仍然没有一间华人教堂。作为蒙神恩典与祝福的以马内利浸信会，我们理当承担起这一项功在当代、利在千秋的时代使命，回应这座城市中真实而迫切的需要。

3. 我们教会的历史与现状

小石城以马内利华语浸信会始于 1990 年 的家庭学生查经班；1993 年在以马内利浸信会聚会；1998 年 正式成为以马内利浸信会的福音堂（a Mission Church of IBC）；2003 年 由五位弟兄姐妹重新开始主日学；2004 年恢复主日崇拜，并邀请不同讲员传讲信息。2021 年 11 月 14 日，教会正式成为独立教会，定名为“小石城以马内利华语浸信会”。2022 年 7 月 3 日，教会搬迁至 Markham Street Baptist Church 的 Fellowship Hall 聚会。

在当周主日的牧者之言《抱雏之窝》（诗 83:4）中提到：Markham Street Baptist Church 已将原教堂赠予阿肯色州浸信会儿童之家与家庭事工（The Arkansas Baptist Children’s Home and Family Ministries），我们目前每月支付 2,000 美元使用场地。这是一个暂时的聚会地点，可谓“骑驴找马”。同时，这里也成为教会成长与训练的机会，使弟兄姐妹在教导、拓展福音、清洁服侍、管家职分，以及儿童与青少年事工等方面得到装备和造就。

根据 2026 年 1 月 11 日 会友会议资料，教会现有会友 94 人（其中活跃会友 78 人，非活跃会友 16 人），大约有XX万美元可用于建堂。

当有同工问：“我们教会要有自己的教堂，这是从神来的异象吗？”李牧师明确回答：“是的，100%确定。”

### 又有人问：“那你觉得我们准备好了吗？”李牧师回答：“是的。”

李牧师和许多代祷勇士早已在祷告中为此预备，他祈求神将这异象清楚地指示给所有弟兄姐妹，使每个人都被激动，心被恩感献上自己，因为“一人不能完成大使命”。当主看见祂的儿女为祂的事工热心起来、行动起来时，祂的心是何等喜乐！

主啊，求你引导我们继续走在祢的道路上。阿门！
