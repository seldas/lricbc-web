**2/23/25 Pastor’s Word**
Pray for and Participate in the 2025 Vacation Bible School

Matt.19: 14 But Jesus said, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.”

Vacation Bible School (VBS) is an outreach service provided by the church to the community, aiming to educate children about God, including faith courses, art, crafts, games, etc. Each church can design its own faith courses or purchase suitable faith courses. Sharing the gospel with children is crucial. Rev. Ron West testified that he and his wife attended VBS as children 70 years ago, and he still vividly remembers what the Sunday school teacher taught. They keep and treasure some crafts they made at that time till now. We hope that our church’s VBS can also leave a deep impression on the children’s hearts and influence them to follow the Lord for a lifetime.

Matthew 19:14 Jesus’ word is the basis and foundation for the church to do children’s ministry. The Lord Jesus taught us, “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.” Actively doing children’s ministry is pleasing to the Lord. Thankfully, our church has held two VBS (2023, https://thebaptistpaper.org/little-rock-chinese-church-thankful-for-year-of-growth-unity-and-answered-prayers/ ; 2024 “Scuba”-2024 Church Summer Bible School https://lricbc.org/?p=1380 ), and this year is the third time. We held the first 2025 VBS preparation meeting last Sunday night and determined the following content.

Theme: Magnified--Discover the bigness of God in the smallest of things

Date: July 15-18, 5:30-8:00 p.m. (Friday “Family Fun Night”); volunteers will set up tables and chairs at 5 p.m.

### Goal: We ask for 45 children

### Here is the prayer guide for this year:

Pray for the children attending VBS

Pray for many children to attend

Pray that children who do not know Christ will invite Him into their lives

Pray that Christian children will grow closer to their Heavenly Father

Pray that children who do not attend church often will attend church regularly.

Pray for VBS volunteers

Pray for wisdom and ability of VBS leaders during preparation.

Pray that the Lord will give us enough volunteers to properly teach and care for the children.

Pray that God will give our VBS team strength, stamina, a good attitude, and the ability to show every child the unconditional love of Christ.

Pray that the words and actions of our entire VBS team will glorify the Lord’s name.

Pray that the Lord will prepare more youth volunteers, so that Christian youth can become Christ’s soldiers, and that young seekers can open their hearts to Christ.

Pray that the Family Fun Night activities will go smoothly, and more parents come to participate.

Pray for follow-up after VBS and that we can build more connections in the community.

We divide into several groups and need relevant volunteers: 1. Teaching Team; 2. Mission Team; 3. Craft Team; 4. Praise Team; 5. Food Team; 6. Reception and Registration Team; 7. Decoration Team; 8. Promotion Team; 9. IT Team; 10. Photography and Video Team; 11. Skit Team, etc. If you are willing to participate in the service, please contact Sister Ying Lan.

May the Lord bless this year’s VBS to have a great victory and glorify the Lord’s name only!

请为2025年教会暑期圣经学校代祷并参与

太19:14耶稣说：“让小孩子到我这里来，不要禁止他们，因为在天国的正是这样的人。”

暑期圣经学校（Vacation Bible School, 英文简称 “VBS”）是教会向社区提供的外展服侍，旨在教育孩子认识上帝，包括信仰课程、艺术、手工艺、游戏等。每间教会可以设计自己的信仰课程或购买适合的信仰课程。与孩子们分享福音至关重要。魏荣恩牧师见证说，70年前他和魏师母小时候参加VBS的场景仍历历在目，当时主日学老师讲的是什么他仍然记忆犹新，他们现在还保留着当时作的一些手工。我们期待我们教会的VBS也能在孩子们心中留下深刻印痕，并影响他们一生跟随主。

太19:14耶稣的话是教会作儿童事工的依据和基础。主耶稣教导我们说：“让小孩子到我这里来，不要禁止他们；因为在天国的，正是这样的人”。积极作儿童事工是讨主喜悦的。感恩的是，我们教会已经举行过两次VBS ( 2023, https://thebaptistpaper.org/little-rock-chinese-church-thankful-for-year-of-growth-unity-and-answered-prayers/; 2024 “海底探险”https://lricbc.org/?p=1380) ，今年是第三次。我们上周日晚召开了2025年第一次VBS筹备会议，确定以下内容。
