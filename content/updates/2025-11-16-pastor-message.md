**11/16/25 Pastor’s Word**
An Initiative Reflection on John Sung

(continued from the above)

My Journey to Xiamen

---
**On June 8, 2025, with a humble and seeking heart, Pastor George and I set out to trace the spiritual footsteps of early missionaries and John Sung. After visiting and studying at Caohu Church, we departed Putian at 3:30 p.m., driving toward Xiamen, a city where ancient history and modern life intertwine.**
Dr. William N. Brown

Around 5 p.m., we met with Professor William N. Brown of Xiamen University [1] as planned. At that time, Xiamen was bustling with traffic and throngs of people; even finding a parking space felt like a luxury. Professor Brown, an American well-versed in Chinese culture, greeted us with a gentle smile and warm demeanor. His conversation was full of humor and wisdom. Although it was our first meeting, there was a sense of familiarity, as if we were old friends reunited. I jokingly asked him, “Xiamen is so crowded—how do you manage to like living here?” I asked this because, compared with Little Rock, where I live in the U.S., Xiamen seemed far livelier and noisier, almost overwhelming.

He replied with a humorous yet profound remark: “I’ve never really liked living here, but God has allowed me to live here for thirty-seven years.” This witty statement brought knowing smiles to both our faces.

Professor Brown clearly loves this land deeply. In 1992, he became the first foreigner in Fujian Province to receive permanent residency. Over the years, he has been actively involved in the study and exchange of local culture, education, and social development. He is regarded as a “China expert” and was recognized as one of CCTV’s “Touching China” figures in 2019. We even saw his familiar presence on YouTube during the 2024 CCTV New Year’s Gala.

That evening, Professor Brown took us to a vegetarian restaurant, where we were the only three guests. During those two short hours, we talked extensively about faith and life—from his daily experiences in China with his wife to my ministry in the U.S. and research on the history of missions in Fujian and John Sung. He shared that he had undergone two cancer surgeries, yet God had preserved him, allowing him to continue working and living in China. I was struck by the irony: he, as an American, knows China better than I do as a Chinese; yet I, a Chinese who has lived in the United States for many years, may not truly understand America.

He earnestly said, “We cannot understand China only through Western media, just as we cannot understand the U.S. only through Chinese media. To truly know a place, you must go there yourself; otherwise, you have no right to comment.” Indeed, seeing with one’s own eyes is far more reliable than secondhand information.

On the topic of faith, he shared about attending registered church gatherings in China. Regarding the relationship between house churches and Three-Self churches, he looked with a broader perspective of God’s kingdom, demonstrating a spirit of humility and insight that deeply inspired me.

As night fell, we had to visit another pastor, so we reluctantly parted with Professor Brown. Before leaving, he gifted me three of his books: Off the Wall—How We Fell for China, Old Gulangyu in Foreigners’ Eyes, and From Quanzhou: Old Pan Talking about the Maritime Silk Road. These became cherished mementos of my journey, helping me gain deeper insights into Fujian’s history, the Maritime Silk Road, and the early missionaries’ impressions of the region.

That night, we visited Dongyu Church in Xiamen and met a pastor couple. Despite the late hour, they and several church coworkers warmly welcomed us, introducing the local church situation. The pastor arranged for Brother Liu and Sister Zhong, a Christian couple, to host us at their family-run guesthouse. Sister Zhong serves as a deacon in the church. They were incredibly kind and hospitable. Although we worried about causing them trouble, they said with smiles, “In the Lord, we are all one family. Meeting together is a blessing, and hosting God’s servants is truly God’s favor.”

Brother Liu remarked, “In other places, people ask how many in your family are Christians; in Fujian, they ask, ‘How many generations in your family are believers?’” This simple question reveals the deep roots of Christianity in Fujian.

The next morning, after enjoying a lovely breakfast prepared by Sister Zhong, we hurried to the pier to take a boat to Gulangyu Island. The river separating Xiamen from Gulangyu was the very route people took when attending John Sung’s revival meetings.

Gulangyu People’s Primary School

After about twenty minutes by ferry, we arrived at Gulangyu. There are no vehicles on the island; everyone travels on foot. A ten-minute walk along a winding path from the pier brought us to Trinity Church. Since it was still early, the reception staff had not yet arrived, so we wandered the area. Everywhere on the island bore the marks of missionary history. Near the church stood Gulangyu People’s Primary School, where children were doing morning exercises. The wall displayed the school’s history:

“The predecessor of Gulangyu People’s Primary School was the Huairen Girls’ School

and Yude Girls’ School, founded in the mid-19th century by British and American

churches. These schools started as primary schools and eventually developed to include

middle schools and teacher training departments. In 1938, the school began admitting

boys, and in 1967 it was renamed Gulangyu People’s Primary School.

Huairen Girls’ School was established in 1877 in Gulangyu by Mrs. Macgregor, the

donations. Jessie Johnston (1861–1907) served as the head. The school initially focused

on Christian teaching and Bible reading, alongside geography, arithmetic, sewing, and

household economy.

Yude Girls’ School was founded in 1870 in Xiamen by Mrs. Eliza Deventer

Talmage, Mrs. Helen Culbertson Kip, and Mrs. Emma C. W. Davis of the Reformed

Church in America. The Chinese name was “Character-Developing School,” later

renamed Yude Girls’ Middle School in 1921.”[2]

Trinity Church in Gulangyu [3]

We returned to Trinity Church. On the outer wall, a cream-colored stone relief depicted The Good Shepherd: amidst green hills and flowing water, Jesus held a staff in his left hand and a lamb in his right, followed by many sheep. His tender gaze conveyed the depth of His love.

The foundation stone of Trinity Church reads:

“The foundation that has been laid is Jesus Christ” (1 Cor. 3:11), with a radiant cross

engraved above, and palm branches extending sideways in heart-shaped forms. Trinity

Church must be built upon the foundation of Christ, forever glorifying the cross, and the

hearts of the congregation prepared as dwelling places of the Holy Spirit. (From the 1935

Trinity Church Constitution and Foundation Stone Inscription)  [4]

Inside, we saw the “List of The Reformed Church Xiamen Missionaries” posted on the second floor. As Hebrews 13:7 reminds: “Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith.”

Elder Lei Yuanyan warmly welcomed us and briefly introduced Trinity Church’s history. He explained the meaning of its name, which signifies unity: the Trinity, the unification of congregations from Xinjie, Zhushu, and Xiagang, and the joint funding by three missionary societies—the Reformed Church in America, the London Missionary Society, and the Presbyterian Church in England.

God placed Trinity Church at the island’s center, where its bell can be heard from all directions. Construction began in October 1934, with a Dutch engineer volunteering an advanced beamless steel roof design, supervising its construction in Hong Kong at his own expense. [5] The Dutch engineer said, “My mother wanted me to study theology and become a preacher. I did not follow her wish to study theology, so whatever work I do for the church anywhere is my volunteer offering to God.”[6]

The roof and rough interior were completed in July 1936. On July 10, 1936, Dr. John Sung presided over the second Nationwide Christian Bible Conference with 1,600 participants, marking the completion of Trinity Church’s first phase. [7]

Elder Lei shared that initially, the church’s neighbors were non-believers, but over the years, God moved them and their families to faith. Eventually, in 1997, Sister Li Jinyan, residing in Canada, donated the adjacent Shien property to Trinity Church,[8] completing its sixty-six-year building history.

Cai Lixia

Learning that I study John Sung, Elder Lei took us to meet a Senior Sister, Cai Lixia, who had personally met Dr. Sung. We arrived around 9 a.m., greeted by her daughter-in-law. Cai played Lord Jesus, When I Think of Thee herself.[9]

At 93, she has been blind since infancy due to a medical mishap. When she was just over one year old, her aunt took her to meet John Sung. Before her aunt started to talk, Sung said, “God has a plan. Your blindness is better than sight.” Though she could not see physically, she spent her life seeing God’s light.

I asked if she had learned piano. She replied, “At twenty, I had lessons at home, but never in formal school.”

I then asked, “When did she get married?”

Her daughter-in-law replied, “She got married around 1960. Her husband was also blind; they met through their work. At that time, a church-run school for the blind was established on Gulangyu Island, and she taught there, instructing blind students in writing and daily living skills. Later, as the number of students declined, the school for the blind was converted into a school for the deaf and mute. She was then reassigned to work at a printing factory for people with disabilities, where she stayed until her retirement.”

After returning from Shanghai, she was already serving as a church organist even before she got married. She has served the Lord faithfully for seventy to eighty years, bearing witness to God’s mighty power through her life. It was only this year that she finally stopped playing the organ at church.

**Pastor George commented, “What Dr. John Sung told you shaped your life. God reveals His will and prepares something even better. Living for God is invaluable!” He added, “Such hymns are wonderful—they embody faith. Today, young people may have skill, but lack that spirituality.” Cai smiled and added, “They cannot express the meaning through the music.”**
Due to our flight schedule, we left hurriedly. Elder Lei guided us through a tunnel to the pier. Curious, I asked why the island was called Gulangyu. Elder Lei explained that the rocks are struck by waves, sounding like drums, hence the name. Specifically, a southern reef’s caves echo waves like a drumbeat.

Gulangyu is indeed a place where remarkable people have left their marks, contributing to the island’s irreplaceable charm. Along the tunnel walls were introductions to notable figures, including China’s first professional vocal educator, the first female choral conductor, composer Zhou Shuyan (1894–1974), virologist and CAS academician Huang Zhenxiang (1910–1987), sports pioneer X John Ma (1882–1966), [10]  famous writer Lin Yutang (1895–1976, who converted to Christianity in old age), and medical missionary Dr. John Abraham Otte (1861–1910), founder of the first Western medical hospital — Hope Hospital — in Xiaoxi and Gulangyu, as well as the first modern medical college and women’s hospital in Fujian.

Conclusion

As a Chinese saying goes, “Read ten thousand books and travel ten thousand miles.”

In a mere evening and morning, we fleetingly passed through Xiamen, a city where history and civilization converge. Though brief, the experiences deeply touched my heart. From visiting Professor Brown, strolling Gulangyu, exploring Trinity Church, to meeting the blind Senior Sister Cai Lixia, each encounter imparted precious spiritual lessons and opened new perspectives for my research on John Sung.

Brother Dai of Trinity Church once said meaningfully, “Church history requires the sedimentation of time and in-depth reflection to better understand God’s will.” This echoes in my heart: all of God’s work is refined and revealed over time.

Looking back, with God, a thousand years is like a day, and a day like a thousand years. One night on earth is but a fleeting instant in eternity. Yet, that evening and morning in Xiamen, under the light of Christ, allowed me a glimpse of eternity. May God’s unceasing glory continue to shine upon this once-favored land and illuminate every heart still seeking a home and yearning to encounter the Lord.    (The end)

[2] The establishment of girls’ schools by missionary wives at that time carried great historical significance. First, it broke through gender barriers and helped eradicate the old Chinese custom of foot-binding, promoting equal educational opportunities for both men and women. Second, it introduced Western educational concepts, laying the foundation for China’s modern system of female education. Third, it used education as a bridge to help the gospel take root and flourish in China.
