* **12.** Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Christ. 13 For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body — whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free—and we were all given the one Spirit to drink. 14 Even so the body is not made up of one part but of many. 15 Now if the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” it would not for that reason stop being part of the body. 16 And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” it would not for that reason stop being part of the body. 17 If the whole body were an eye,  where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? 18 But in fact God has placed the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be. 19 If they were all one part, where would the body be? 20 As it is, there are many parts, but one body. 21 The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need you!” And the head cannot say to the feet, “I don’t need you!” 22 On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, 23 and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty, 24 while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the parts that lacked it, 25 so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other. 26 If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it. 27 Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.

### 信息摘要
### 同工分享主日崇拜经文

> **Scripture:** Sharing by Brothers and Sisters — Colossians 3:23
### 哥林多前书 (1 Cor) 12: 12-27
* **12.** 就如身子是一个，却有许多肢体，而且肢体虽多，仍是一个身子；基督也是这样。 13 我们不拘是犹太人，是希腊人，是为奴的，是自主的，都从一位圣灵受洗， 成了一个身体，饮于一位圣灵。 14 身子原不是一个肢体，乃是许多肢体。 15 设若脚说：“我不是手，所以不属乎身子”，它不能因此就不属乎身子。 16 设若耳说：“我不是眼，所以不属乎身子”，它也不能因此就不属乎身子。 17 若全身是眼，从哪里听声呢？若全身是耳，从哪里闻味呢？ 18 但如今，神随自己的意思把肢体俱各安排在身上了。 19 若都是一个肢体，身子在哪里呢？ 20 但如今肢体是多的，身子却是一个。 21 眼不能对手说：“我用不着你。”头也不能对脚说：“我用不着你。” 22 不但如
此，身上肢体人以为软弱的，更是不可少的； 23 身上肢体我们看为不体面的，越发给它加上体面；不俊美的，越发得着俊美； 24 我们俊美的肢体，自然用不着装饰。但神配搭这身子，把加倍的体面给那有缺欠的肢体， 25 免得身上分门别类，总要肢体彼此相顾。 26 若一个肢体受苦，所有的肢体就一同受苦；若一个肢体得荣耀，所有的肢体就一同快乐。 27 你们就是基督的身子，并且各自做肢体。  
### 歌罗西书 (Col) 3: 23
* **23.** 无论做什么，都要从心里做，像是给主做的，不是给人做的。
* **23.** Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not
for human masters.
