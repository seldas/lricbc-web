Martin Luther’s Preface to The Epistle to the Romans

(Continue from above)

Ch. 12—God-pleasing Worship

43. In the twelfth chapter the apostle teaches us the true worship of God, and declares all Christians priests, calling upon them to offer up sacrifices, which are to be not money or cattle, as under the Law, but their own bodies and the slaying of their lusts. Next he describes the out-working conduct of Christians in their spiritual government; how they are to teach, preach, rule, serve, give, suffer, love, live, and act towards their friends, enemies, and everybody else. These are works such as a Christian does. For, as was stated before, faith is never idle.

Ch. 13—Our Duty Towards Government And All Men

44. In the thirteenth chapter the apostle instructs us how to honour and obey the civil government, which has been ordained for the following purpose: Although it does not make people pious in the sight of God, still it effects this much, that the godly enjoy external peace and protection, and the wicked are not free to do evil without fear, with impunity, and unmolested. For this reason the civil government must be honoured even by the godly, although they have no need of it. Finally, he comprises everything under the head of love, and encloses it in the example of Christ; as He has done for us, we are to do likewise and follow after Him.

Ch. 14—Our Duty Towards Weaker Brethren

45. In the fourteenth chapter the apostle teaches us how to treat tenderly the weak consciences of believers, and to spare them, by using the liberty of Christians, not to the injury, but to the advancement of weak brethren. For wherever this is not done, discord and contempt of the Gospel, which is of paramount importance, will ensue. Accordingly, it is better to yield somewhat to those weak in faith until they become stronger than to permit the teaching of the Gospel utterly to perish. To do this is an especial work of love, and it is quite necessary even to-day, because by boldly and inconsiderately eating forbidden meats and taking other liberties when there is no necess-ity for it, the tender consciences of people become confused before they learn to know the truth of this matter.

Ch. 15—Christian Love

46. In the fifteenth chapter the apostle places before us the example of Christ, to teach us that we must bear with other weak brethren, such as show their frailty by manifest sins or by unpleasant manners. Such persons we must not cast aside, but bear with them until they, too, are improved. For so Christ has treated us, and is still treating us every day; He tolerates in us a great many things that are not virtues, but evil habits, in addition to all our imperfections, and succours us unceasingly.

47. In conclusion, he prays for them, praises them, commends them to God, indicates to them his office as a preacher, and solicits in a very seemly manner a contribution for the poor at Jerusalem. In short, it is all love that he is talking about and inculcating.

Ch. 16—Salutations and a Warning

48. The last chapter is a chapter of salutations, but he weaves into it a very solemn warning against doctrines of men which are introduced along with the teaching of the Gospel and cause offences. It reads as if he had foreseen with certainty that out of Rome and through the Romans would come the misleading, offensive canons and decretals, and all the brood and breed of human laws and commands which now have overwhelmed the whole world, so that they have done away with this epistle and all the Holy Scriptures, together with the Spirit and faith, leaving nothing except their idol, the belly, as servants of which St. Paul denounces them in this chapter. God save us from them! Amen.

Summary

49. You find, then, in this epistle, the greatest abundance of things that a Christian ought to know what the Law is, the Gospel, sin, punishment, grace, faith, righteousness, Christ, God, good works, love, hope, cross-bearing, also how we are to conduct ourselves in every relation toward those of strong and those of weak faith, toward friends, toward enemies, and toward ourselves. Moreover, all this teaching has been masterfully built up on Scripture ground, and illustrated by the apostle’s personal example and by the example of the prophets, so that there is nothing left for us to desire. It seems, therefore, that the apostle’s object in this epistle was to draw up a syllabus of the entire Christian and evangelical doctrine, and to prepare an introduction to the entire Old Testament. For any person who has received this epistle into his heart has without question the light and strength of the Old Testament in himself. Accordingly, let every Christian become familiar with this epistle, and put it into constant practice. To this end may God grant us His grace! Amen.                         (The end)

马丁·路德的《罗马书》序言

（接上文）

第十二章——讨神喜悦的敬拜

43. 在第十二章中，使徒教导我们真正的敬拜，并宣布所有基督徒都是祭司，呼吁他们献祭，这些祭品不是律法规定的金钱或牲畜，而是他们自己的身体和消除他们的罪欲。接着，他描述了基督徒在圣灵掌管中的外在行为：他们如何教导、传道、治理、服侍、奉献、受苦、愛心、生活和对待他们的朋友、敌人和其他人。这些都是基督徒所做的工作。因为，如前所述，信仰永远不会无所事事。

第十三章 ——我们对政府和所有人的责任

44. 在第十三章中，使徒教导我们如何尊重和服从政府，政府的设立是为了以下目的：虽然政府不会使人们在上帝面前变得虔诚，但它的作用却非常大，使虔诚的人享受外部的和平与保护，而恶人则不能毫无畏惧、不受惩罚、不受骚扰地做恶。因此，虔诚的人也必须尊重政府，尽管他们并不需要它。最后，他将一切都归结为愛，并将其包含在基督的榜样中，正如基督为我们所做的那样，我们也要这样做并追随基督。

第十四章——我们对软弱弟兄的责任

45. 在第十四章中，使徒教导我们如何温柔地对待信徒软弱的良心，并通过使用基督徒的自由来保护他们，不是伤害软弱的弟兄，而是促进他们。因为无论在哪里不这样做，都会产生对至关重要的福音的不和和蔑视。因此，最好是向那些信仰软弱的人稍微屈服，直到他们变得更加强大，而不是让福音的教导完全消亡。这样做是一项特别的愛心工作，即使在今天也是非常必要的，因为通过大胆和不顾后果地吃禁食并在没有必要的情况下采取其他自由，人们软弱的良心在他们了解这件事的真相之前就变得困惑了。

第十五章—基督徒之愛

46. 在第十五章中，使徒向我们展示了基督的榜样，教导我们必须容忍其他软弱的弟兄，比如那些通过明显的罪或不愉快的举止表现出软弱的人。我们不能抛弃这样的人，而要容忍他们，直到他们也得到改善。因为基督就是这样对待我们的，而且每天都在这样对待我们；除了我们所有的缺点之外，他还容忍我们身上许多不是美德而是恶习的东西，并不断地帮助我们。

47. 最后，他为他们祈祷，赞美他们，将他们托付给上帝，向他们表明他作为传道人的职责，并以非常得体的方式为耶路撒冷的穷人募捐。简而言之，他谈论和谆谆教诲的都是愛心。

第十六章—问候和警告

48. 最后一章是问候，但他在其中插入一个非常严肃的警告，反对人为的教义，这些教义通过福音的教导混进来，并引起（对纯正福音的）冒犯。读起来好像保罗已经确切地预见到，从罗马和通过罗马人，会出现误导性的、令人反感的教规和教令，以及现在已经淹没了整个世界的各种各样的人为法律和命令，因此他们废除了这封书信和所有的圣经，连同圣灵和信仰，只留下他们的偶像，肚腹。他们正是圣保罗在本章中所谴责的仆人。愿上帝拯救我们脱离他们！阿门。

总结

49. 那么，你会发现，在这封书信中，基督徒应该知道的最多的事是律法、福音、罪、惩罚、恩典、信仰、公义、基督、上帝、善行、愛心、盼望、背负十字架，以及我们如何对待信仰坚定的人和信仰软弱的人、对待朋友、对待敌人和对待我们自己。此外，所有这些教导都是在圣经的基础上巧妙地建立起来的，并通过使徒的个人榜样和先知的榜样来说明，这样我们就没有什么可渴望的了。因此，使徒写这封书信中的目的似乎是起草一份整个基督徒和福音教义的大纲，并准备了整个旧约的导论。因为任何把这封书信记在心里的人，毫无疑问都会有旧约的亮光和力量。因此，让每个基督徒都熟悉这封书信，并不断付诸实践。为此，愿上帝赐予我们祂的恩典！阿门。（全文完）
