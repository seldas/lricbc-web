PRECIOUS BLOOD

Elinda West --Early Prayer April 10, 2025

The Resurrection celebration is coming, and I’ve already been thinking about and preparing my heart for celebrating the most important holiday of the year. I know you are preparing, too! Our church celebration is about worship and reminding us of what Jesus did for us when He died and then rose again!  Here in our Early Morning Prayer time and in our churches, we often pray thanking Jesus for His precious blood shed for us on the cross! I’m so thankful for God’s love and grace!  Can our words thank Him enough?! I don’t think so.  We must live our life for Him!

Wei Mushr often goes to the blood bank here in our city to donate blood. When he does that, he is giving part of his life so that another person might live. We just read in our scripture that “the life of the body is in its blood.” If a person has no blood running through his veins, he has no life. Sometimes when there is a shortage of blood at the blood bank there will be blood drive so that people will come to volunteer to give their blood.  Jesus knew that His blood would be given in a greater way than a blood drive.

Rather than giving life to one or a few other people, His blood gives life to all who accept Him. There are three favorite hymns of mine that talk about the blood of Jesus. In one of them the words say, “What can wash away my sin? Nothing but the blood of Jesus; What can make me whole again? Nothing but the blood of Jesus.” Another hymn I love says, “There is power, power, wonder working power, in the precious blood of the Lamb.”  The third hymn I’m thinking about was sung at my father’s funeral, the words say, “O victory in Jesus, My Savior forever. He sought me and bought me with His redeeming blood.”

What is the power of the blood of Jesus and why do we sing about it? If you think about the meaning of the blood of Jesus in Christianity–it is EVERYTHING. In Hebrews 9:22 we are reminded that without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins. If Jesus did not die on the cross and shed his precious blood for our sins, then we have no hope of forgiveness. That means this blood that Jesus shed has POWER to wash away sins and should mean EVERYTHING to us believers! Today we look at four things the Blood of Jesus can do.

THE BLOOD OF JESUS IS LIFE-GIVING (Leviticus 17:11)

Jesus’ blood purifies us, making us right with the LORD. It is the blood given in exchange for a life that makes purification possible. Ephesians 1:7 says, “In Him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God’s Grace.”

THE BLOOD OF JESUS WAS NECESSARY (Colossians 1:20, Matthew 26:28)

We think about the time when the angel of death was going to take the first-born sons of Egypt because Pharaoh would not let the Israelites go. Blood from a pure animal was the NECESSARY action to protect the first born from death.  This was the foreshadowing of the blood that Christ would one day shed on the cross to protect all of us who accept Him…from eternal death.

THE BLOOD OF JESUS GIVES FREEDOM (Revelations 1:5)

He loves us and has freed us from our sins by His precious blood! We no longer live under the bondage and condemnation of sin.  Jesus’ blood sets us free from the punishment of sin. Because He has the victory, we who follow Him share in His victory! We have no fear of separation from God.

THE BLOOD OF JESUS WAS PERFECT (1Peter 1:18-19)

In order for Jesus’ blood to make a difference, He needed to be perfect. And because He is fully God and fully man, He is perfect! Sinful people need a SIN-LESS Savior. Jesus purified us whiter than snow with His perfect blood. John 1:29 says, “The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, ‘Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” So …His blood gives LIFE, it was NECESSARY, it gives us FREEDOM and it was PERFECT. Because of His great love to lay down His life, we can believe and trust in Him, have Eternal Hope that we have been covered by the Lamb of God! We need to feel so Joyful, so Encouraged, so Thankful today and in the coming Resurrection celebration … for the life we have because Jesus shed His precious blood for us and had victory over death! Halleluia!!

宝血

魏愛玲師母-- 2025年4月10日早祷

复活节庆祝活动即将到来，我已经开始思考并做好了庆祝一年中最重要的节日的心理准备。我知道你们也在准备！我们教会的庆祝活动是为了敬拜，并提醒我们耶稣死而复活时为我们做了什么！在我们清晨的祷告和教会里，我们常常祷告感谢耶稣在十字架上为我们流出的宝血！我无比感谢上帝的愛和恩典！我们的言语不足以表达我们对衪的感谢吗？！我想是的。我们必须为衪而活！

魏牧师经常去我们城市的血库献血。他这样做，就是为了救活另一个人，献出自己的一部分生命。我们刚刚在经文里读到：“血里有生命。”如果一个人的血管里没有血液，他就没有生命。有时，当血库血液短缺时，就会举行献血活动，让人们自愿献血。耶稣知道，衪的血将以比献血活动更伟大的方式被奉献。

祂的宝血不只是赐给一人或少数人生命，而是赐给所有接受祂的人生命。我最喜欢的三首赞美诗都谈到耶稣的宝血。其中一首歌词是：“什么能洗净我的罪？唯有耶稣的宝血；什么能使我完全？唯有耶稣的宝血。” 我喜欢的另一首赞美诗是这样的：“羔羊的宝血里有力量，力量，奇妙的大能。” 我正在思考的第三首赞美诗是在我父亲的葬礼上唱的，歌词是：“耶稣，我永远的救主，我的得胜。他寻找我，用衪救赎的宝血赎买了我。”

耶稣宝血的大能是什么？我们为什么要歌颂它？如果你思考耶稣宝血在基督信仰中的意义——它无所不包。希伯来书9:22提醒我们，若不流血，罪就不得赦免。如果耶稣没有死在十字架上，没有为我们的罪流出宝血，我们就没有蒙赦免的盼望。这意味着耶稣所流的宝血有能力洗净我们的罪，对我们信徒来说，这宝血的意义重大！今天我们来看耶稣宝血的四大功效。

第一，耶稣的宝血赐予生命（利未记 17:11）。耶稣的宝血洁净我们，使我们与主和好。正是这宝血换来了生命，才使洁净成为可能。以弗所书 1:7 说：“我们藉这愛子的血得蒙救赎，过犯得以赦免，乃是照他丰富的恩典。”

第二，耶稣的血是必需的（歌罗西书1:20，马太福音26:28）。我们回想当年，法老不肯放走以色列人，灭命天使要带走埃及的长子。为了保护长子免于死亡，纯洁动物的血是必要的。这预示着基督有一天会在十字架上流出宝血，保护我们所有接受祂的人……免于永恒的死亡。

第三，耶稣的宝血赐予我们自由（启示录 1:5）。祂愛我们，并用祂的宝血将我们从罪中释放出来！我们不再活在罪的捆绑和定罪之下。耶稣的宝血将我们从罪的惩罚中释放出来。因为祂已经得胜，跟随祂的人也分享祂的胜利！我们不再惧怕与神分离。

第四，耶稣的宝血是完美的（彼得前书 1:18-19）。耶稣的宝血若要发挥功效，祂必须是完美的。因为祂是完全的神，也是完全的人，祂是完美的！罪人需要一位无罪的救主。耶稣用祂完美的宝血洁净了我们，使我们比雪更白。约翰福音1:29说：“第二天，约翰看见耶稣来到他那里，就说：‘看哪，神的羔羊，除去世人罪孽的！’” 所以……祂的宝血赐予我们生命，这是必要的，它赐予我们自由，而且是完美的。因着祂舍命的大愛，我们可以相信祂，信靠祂，并拥有永恒的盼望，因我们已被神的羔羊遮盖！我们今天以及在即将到来的复活节庆典中，都应当满心喜乐、满怀鼓舞、充满感恩——因为耶稣为我们流出宝血，战胜了死亡，我们因此得着了生命！哈利路亚！！
