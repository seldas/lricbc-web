Flushing the Filter

But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. -John 4: 14

“What’s the problem here?” I asked myself after I had turned on the irrigation system. Instead of the usual erratic clicking, the fertilizer injector was only emitting an occasional erratic click, creaking and groaning as if under a burden. The lush, blooming flowers in their hanging pots would shortly wilt and die for lack of sustaining water and nutrients that were somehow being blocked from flowing through the irrigation system.

“It must be the filter,” I decided. I shut off the water, disassembled the protective casing of the filter, and removed the screen. It was clogged with so much limestone and other sediment that only a little water could flow through. Flushing out the sediment with a blast of water made the filter good as new again.

Today’s key verse reveals Jesus as the source of living water from which our souls can freely drink and be satisfied. This water is available to “whosoever will” (Revelation 22:17). A person who does not frequently replenish his natural body with water will soon dehydrate and eventually die. Likewise it is vital that we drink of the living water from Christ’s fountain to replenish the thirst of our souls and to sustain spiritually alive in Him.

Satan’s aim is to “clog the filter” of our hearts with sin and untruth, thereby restricting the flow of this life-sustaining water. Through the appeals of our carnal nature, he can cause the sediments of pride, lust, hate, anger, strife, or envy to accumulate in our lives. Let us frequently and thoroughly “flush the filter” by maintaining a good relationship with our Savior, so that His living water can always flow through and sustain our souls. Joshua Zimmerman – Pikeville, TN

Come to this water, there is a vast supply; there is a river that never shall run dry.

– David and Max Sapp

冲洗过滤器

“人若喝我所赐的水的，就永远不渴；我所赐的水要在他里头成为泉源，直涌到永生”。

### -约翰福音 4:14

“出了什么问题？”我打开灌溉器后反问自己。灌溉器没有像往常那样发出规则的咔嗒声，而是偶尔发出不规则的咔嗒声，吱吱作响，仿佛承受着重负。因为缺乏维持水分和养分，悬挂在花盆里的茂盛花朵很快就会枯萎死亡，而这些养分不知何故被阻止流过灌溉系统。

“一定是过滤器的问题，”我断定。我关掉水，拆开过滤器的保护壳，取下筛网。筛网被太多的石灰石和其他沉积物堵塞，只有一点水可以流过。用水冲洗掉沉积物后，过滤器又焕然一新了。

今天的钥节揭示了耶稣是活水的源泉，我们的灵魂可以自由地从中汲取并得到满足。这水是“凡愿意的人”都可以得到的（启示录 22:17）。一个不经常用水补充身体水分的人很快就会脱水，并最终死亡。同样，我们必须从基督的泉源中喝活水，以补充我们灵魂的干渴，并在祂里面保持灵性的活力。

撒旦的目的是用罪恶和谎言“堵塞”我们心灵的过滤器，从而限制这种维持生命的活水流淌。通过我们肉体的诱惑，它可以让骄傲、欲望、仇恨、愤怒、冲突或嫉妒的沉积物堆积在我们的生命中。让我们通过与我们的救主保持良好的关系，经常彻底地“冲洗过滤器”，以便祂的活水可以一直流过，并维系我们的灵魂。

约书亚·齐默尔曼 – 田纳西州派克维尔

“请来就近来这水，这里水源充足；这是一条永不干涸的河流”。

– 大卫和马克斯·萨普
