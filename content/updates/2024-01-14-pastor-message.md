“Joyful Watchmen”: Morning Prayer Meeting Update

Habakkuk 2:1 “I will stand at my watch and station myself on the ramparts; I will look to see what he will say to me, and what answer I am to give to this complaint.

The Bible often mentions “watchmen.” In ancient societies, the role of a watchman was to observe the movements of enemies from the city walls, ensuring the safety of the people within. When they saw enemies approaching with swords, they would blow the trumpet, alerting the people to react promptly to preserve their lives (Ezekiel 33:1-6). The church needs watchmen, individuals who, through prayer, remain vigilant before God, interceding for the growth and revival of the nation, the church, families, and each brother and sister. We are thankful that many watchmen have arisen among us. Since January 2nd, the church's early morning prayer at 5 has been ongoing for two weeks, with an average of more than 10 brothers and sisters participating each time. This includes a sister from Oklahoma, a sister from Texarkana, and a seminary student from the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. Last Saturday, there were 16 brothers and sisters.

The current format is basically as follows:

Monday to Friday at 5:00 AM; Saturday at 6:00 AM. Each session lasts for one hour.

Led by a different brother or sister each day.

### Basic sequence:

a. A hymn

b. A passage of scripture

c. 3-5 minutes of a brief sharing

d. Sharing prayer requests

e. (When there are more than 8 people, we will divide into) group prayer

f. Return to the main gathering at 5:55 AM, pastor concludes with a prayer, and everyone says “Amen” together before dispersing.

In the past ten days, we have deeply felt the power of prayer. The phrase “Immanuel,” meaning “God with us,” has become even more real. After praying together, there is a sense of increased love and fervor from the Lord to face family, work, life, and studies. I would like to share two examples of answered prayers here. On the first day, a child at school did not behave well. After brothers and sisters earnestly prayed for him, the father approached the child with more gentleness, speaking the truth in love. As a result, the child behaved well in school for the next two days. Another instance involves difficulty with the church's VBS scheduling due to the Day Care program ending at 6:00 PM in the building we currently use. Eleven watchmen prayed for this during Wednesday morning prayer. God heard our prayers. When I arrived at the church, Sherry, the secretary of Arkansas Baptist Children &amp; Family Ministries, came to tell me, “Our coordinator, Brother Derek, supports and encourages your church to hold VBS, as long as the starting time can be delayed from last year's 5:00 PM to 5:30 PM.” Thanks be to God; He hears our prayers.

Regarding the Morning Prayer Meeting, Mrs. Wei shared, “Praise God for answering our prayers! It has brought all of us closer to our Heavenly Father, and we feel more peaceful and joyful! Thank you, Lord 🙏❤️.”

Sister Zhan mentioned, “The Morning Prayer Meeting is truly wonderful. I used to have trouble sleeping, but now I can sleep a lot, and every moment of sleep feels like a blessing. Since joining the morning prayer, my mood has been exceptionally good, and the day is filled with joy and peace!”

Brother Zhang expressed, “Thanks to the prompting of the Holy Spirit, bringing brothers and sisters one by one to the throne of the Lord in the early morning to draw strength from Him. May the Lord continue to guard our morning prayer service next week and find pleasure in it.”

A seminary student shared, “Your enthusiastic service and earnest prayers are a wonderful blessing and encouragement to me, the humble younger brother. Thank you! May the Lord send down a mighty fire to burn within us, refining us! Make us holy vessels, living our lives for the Lord, wholeheartedly dedicating ourselves, and living for the Lord! May the Lord greatly revive the Chinese Church in Little Rock! Anoint every warrior of the Lord! Preach the Gospel and win souls!”

Participating in the Morning Prayer Meeting benefits us the most. The more we pray, the more joy we experience, the more we are released, and the more we receive healing and freedom. Engaging in morning prayer is not about changing others but about changing ourselves. Each time we pray, our aim is not to achieve our goals but to fulfill God's purposes. Instead of asking how we want things to be, we inquire about God's will, seeking to understand how He wants us to proceed.

We encourage more brothers and sisters to join the army of the Morning Prayer Meeting! If you cannot participate every day, you are welcome to join the Saturday morning prayer at 6:00 AM. Don't worry if your prayers are not eloquent or captivating; God delights in worship that comes from a sincere heart. Don't worry if you are not skilled in prayer; your participatory spirit is the best offering to please God. Don't worry if you cannot commit every day; feel free to join us whenever you can! As the ancient Chinese saying “Rose with the rooster's crow,” today we follow the example of David: “147 I rise before dawn and cry for help; I have put my hope in your word. My eyes stay open through the watches of the night, that I may meditate on your promises. Hear my voice in accordance with your love; preserve my life, Lord, according to your laws.” (Psalm 119:147-9)

Morning Prayer Meetings awaken oneself, awaken the church, and bring revival! May God continue to revive and use the church's Morning Prayer Meetings to glorify His name alone. Amen

### “喜乐的守望者”：教会晨祷会更新

哈2: 1 我要站在守望所，立在望楼上观看，看耶和华对我说什么话，我可用什么话向他诉冤 。

圣经中常提到”守望者”（watchman）。在古代社会，守望者的任务就是负责在城楼上察看敌人在远方的举动，确保城内人的安全。 当他见到敌人带着刀剑来袭击，他们就要吹号，让城内的人及时反应，保存性命（结33:1-6）。 教会中需要有守望者，就是要有一批人借着祈祷在上帝面前警醒，为国家、教会、家庭及每位弟兄姐妹的灵命成长和复兴祷告。感谢天父在我们中间兴起许多守望者。自从1月2日起，教会早5点钟的晨更早祷会已经进行了两周，每次平均有十多位弟兄姐妹参加。其中包括一位奥克拉荷马的姐妹、一位特克萨卡纳的姐妹和一位西南浸信会神学院的神学生。上周六有16位弟兄姐妹。

### 现在的形式基本是这样的：

### 1. 周一到周五早5: 00；周六早6: 00。每次一个小时。

2. 每天由一位弟兄或姐妹轮流带领。

### 3. 基本次序：

a. 一首诗歌

b. 一段经文

c. 3-5分钟简短分享

d.分享代祷事项

e. （超过8个人后）分组祷告

### f. 在早5:55返回到主会场，牧师作结束祷告大家同声说 “阿门” 后散会 。

在过去十天中，我们深切感受到祈祷的力量。”以马内利”主与我们同在这句话变得更加真实。大家一起祈祷后，感觉心中有更多来自主的愛和火热去面对家庭、工作、生活和学习。我在这里分享两个祈祷蒙应允的小例子。小朋友第一天在学校不太听话、表现不太好。弟兄姐妹恳求为他代祷后，爸爸对待小朋友的态度有更多温柔，在愛心中讲真理，结果接下来的两天他在学校表现良好。另一件事是，教会VBS安排有困难，因为现在我们用的Building开始了Day Care每天下午6点放学。周三晨祷会11位守望者为此代祷。上帝垂听祷告。结果我一到教会，Arkansas Baptist Children &amp; Family Ministries秘书Sherry就主动告诉我说：”我们的负责人Derek弟兄支持和鼓励你们教会举行VBS，只要时间从去年的下午5:00开始推迟5:30开始”。感谢主，上帝垂听祷告。

关于晨祷会魏师母见证说：”赞美神回应了我们的祷告，让我们所有人都更加接近我们的天父，并感到更加平安和喜乐！ 谢谢主🙏❤️”

詹姐妹说：”晨祷会真是太好了。我从前睡眠不好，现在睡眠可多了，能睡觉都是幸福的。自从参加晨祷后我心情特别好，而且一天都充满喜乐和平安！”

张弟兄说：”感恩圣灵的感召，带弟兄姐妹们一个一个的清晨来到主的宝座前支取主给我们的力量。求主继续保守我们下周的晨祷服侍蒙祂喜悦。”

一位神学生说：”你们的热心服侍、恳切呼求对小弟兄是非常美好的祝福和激励！谢谢你们！愿主赐下烈火来焚烧我们！炼净我们！使我们成为圣洁荣耀的器皿，一生为主，竭诚奉献，为主而活！愿主大大复兴小石城华人教会！膏抹每一位主的精兵！传扬福音，赢得灵魂！”

参加晨祷会受益最大的是我们自己。我们越祷告越喜乐、越祷告越得释放、越祷告越得医治和自由。操练晨祷不是要改变别人，而是要改变自己。我们每次祷告不是要达成我们的目标，而是达成上帝的目标。我们不是问我们要怎样，而是要问上帝的旨意是什么，上帝要我们怎样。

我们鼓励更多的弟兄姐妹加入到晨祷会的大军中来！如果你无法每天参加，欢迎你参加周六早六点的晨祷会；不用担心你的祷告词不够优美或动听，上帝喜悦的是心灵诚实的敬拜；不用担心你不会祷告，你参与的心就是讨上帝喜悦的最好祭物；不用担心你无法每天坚持，欢迎你随时参与！古人闻鸡起舞。今人效法大卫的榜样：”我趁天未亮呼求，我仰望了你的言语。我趁夜更未换，将眼睁，为要思想你的话语。求你照你的慈愛，听我的声音。耶和华啊，求你照你的典章将我救活”（诗119：147-9）。晨祷会唤醒自己、唤醒教会，带来复兴！愿上帝继续复兴和使用教会的晨祷会。

周一到周五早5：00，周六早6：00。每次一个小时。周日没有。由弟兄姐妹轮流带领，欢迎弟兄姐妹参加。Zoom ID:501.501.7777,密码:777。
