**6/22/25 Pastor’s Word**
Practicing Gratitude, Part 4

Scripture Reading: Psalms 16:5-6, Exodus 20:17

When you’re trying to fan your flame of gratitude, comparison douses it like a bucket of ice water.

Comparison means looking at what someone else has and thinking about how much better or worse it is than what you have. It’s so dangerous that the 10th commandment warns against it. “You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor” (Exodus 20:17).

Comparison sabotages two relationships at the same time: your relationship with God, and your relationship with other people. You can’t fully love others when you’re jealous of them or trying to outperform them. And you can’t love God when you think maybe God has given you a bad deal.

When you feel the urge to compare your lot in life with someone else’s, replace that thought with a prayer of gratitude. A good example comes from Psalm 16. “The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup; you hold my lot. The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; I have a goodly heritage.” (Psalm 16:5–6).

The writer of the psalm acknowledges God as the source of his provision. He declares that what God has given him is good. This is an antidote to comparison.

### Practice:

Think about the last time you compared yourself to someone else or compared what you have to what someone else has.

Thank God for blessing that person.

Thank God for your lot in life – exactly the way it is right now.

Today when you notice yourself making a comparison, make a list of the good things that God has blessed you with in this area.

Before you go to bed tonight, do a comparison inventory. Ask yourself: Am I jealous of anyone else? Do I need to say “thank you, God” for what I have?

Prayer: God, thank you for setting boundaries around what is mine. I am grateful for the lot you’ve given me. Be my proof against envy and unhappiness. Amen.

操练感恩四

### 阅读经文：诗篇 16:5-6，出埃及记 20:17

当你试图激起感恩的火焰时，“比较”就像一桶冷水把它浇熄。

“比较”意味着看着别人拥有的，然后衡量它比自己的是好还是差。这是如此危险，以致第十诫特别警告我们不要这样做：“不可贪恋人的房屋；也不可贪恋人的妻子、仆婢、牛驴，并他一切所有的。”（出埃及记 20:17）

“比较”会破坏两种关系：你与神的关系，以及你与他人的关系。当你嫉妒别人或试图胜过别人时，就无法完全地爱他们。同样地，当你认为神对你不公平时，也难以爱神。

当你忍不住拿自己与他人比较时，把这个念头转为感恩的祷告。诗篇第16篇是一个好例子：“耶和华是我的产业，是我杯中的分；我所得的，你为我持守。用绳量给我的地界，坐落在佳美之处；我的产业实在美好。”（诗篇 16:5-6）

诗人承认神是他一切供应的源头，并宣告神赐给他的一切都是美好的。这正是对抗“比较”的解药。

### 操练：

回想你上一次与别人比较自己或自己所拥有的是什么时候。

为那人所蒙的祝福感谢神。

为神赐给你的人生样貌感谢祂。

今天，当你发现自己在比较，列出神在这方面赐给你的祝福。

今晚睡前进行一次“比较盘点”：我是否嫉妒任何人？我是否需要对神说：“谢谢祢赐给我所拥有的一切”？

### 祷告：

神啊，感谢祢为我设下生活的边界。感谢祢赐给我所拥有的一切。求祢成为我对抗嫉妒和不满的见证。阿们。
