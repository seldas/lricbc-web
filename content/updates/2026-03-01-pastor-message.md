A Journey to Seeking Root

(Continued)

### • Memories of My Father

In my childhood memories, my father was a solitary man with a quick temper. From the earliest days I can recall, nearly every morning was filled with the sounds of my parents arguing. My father spent his whole life struggling against fate, yet it seemed he never truly overcame it. He always wanted to lift our family out of poverty and achieve prosperity; he longed to leave the countryside, do business in the city, and accomplish something significant—but he repeatedly failed to achieve his goal. He was a man born at the difficult time, with aspirations constantly colliding with harsh realities. Perhaps it was this helplessness before life, or a sense of being unrecognized for his talents, that caused my memory of him never to include a genuine, hearty laugh.

The one blessing amid misfortune was that my father came to know the Lord. When my mother began attending church in 1990, my father fully supported her. He often said, “From the ancient books, I already knew that the God of Christianity is the true God. Unlike the so-called ‘gods’ the Chinese worship, He is the One we call ‘Heavenly Grandpa (Chinese spelling: Lao Tian Ye),’ unique and almighty.” When I was sick, my father led the whole family in prayer, firmly believing that no one but God could heal me.

Just as our household’s circumstances began to improve, a sudden disaster struck. The cow we had, along with a calf and another unborn one, were all stolen overnight. My father searched everywhere but found nothing. The stress overwhelmed him, and his health rapidly declined. Doctors diagnosed liver cancer and warned that he did not have much time left. Upon learning this, my father urgently requested that the church elder could come and baptize him. He said, “I’ve lived my life corrupted by the devil, never enjoying real blessings. But before I die, I must follow the Lord.”

His faith saved him. Elder and fellow church workers personally measured and tailored ceremonial burial clothes. When the clothes were finished, the elder remarked, “This old man won’t be staying with us much longer. Every inch of fabric and thread was used perfectly; not a scrap left.” (Note: The elder’s words reflect a cultural perspective in China, where certain events that occur are often regarded as symbols or omens of things yet to come. This is presented solely as a factual account and should not be taken as guidance for Christian faith practice.)

Less than a week after his baptism, my father passed away peacefully. Though he experienced discomfort during his illness, he was never in severe pain and could still care for himself, even walking outside daily, until the final afternoon of his life.

On Tuesday, August 20, 1996, he lay on the heated bed in Northeast China, murmuring, “Shoes, put on my shoes! Open the window, I want to go out!” At seventeen, I remained unusually calm, immediately understanding that he wanted to wear his ceremonial burial clothes—his soul was about to go to God.

I urged the family to dress him in clean, white, cross-embroidered burial clothes, and put on his hat and shoes. Elders from the village came to support us. Family members took turns keeping vigil by his side. Late at night, our hearts were heavy with sorrow as we silently mourned the impending loss.

Around one o’clock in the morning, he suddenly wanted to eat. My mother thought he was recovering, but in reality, it was a final flicker of life. After finishing his meal, he passed away quietly and peacefully.

That Sunday before my father’s passing, I was preaching at church. I read John 14:1–3: “Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me. In my Father’s house are many rooms... I am going there to prepare a place for you.” Those verses seemed to foretell what was about to happen and brought deep peace to my heart.

During his memorial service, many people from the church attended. The choir, dressed in white, sang hymns as they sent him off. The elder preached: “From a human perspective, brother Li’s work seems unfinished—his children have yet to marry—but God has His plan and has prepared an eternal home for him.”

My father was buried at the foot of Yuanshan Mountain, surrounded by clear waters and scenic beauty. Village elders helped with the funeral, and my siblings and I accompanied him on his last journey.

My father’s passing brought immense grief, especially to my mother. A man is the mountain of a woman; when the father left, the mother’s mountain collapsed. Amid the cries of farewell, I sensed my mother’s despair and helplessness. Yet, “God sets the lonely in families; He leads out the prisoners with singing” (Psalm 68:5). The care from church brothers and sisters deeply comforted our hearts.

Autumn was ending, and the corn had to be harvested before the first snow. Without my father, the work was impossible to complete. Brothers and sisters from Xin Hua Church came to help; in two days, all the corn was safely stored. Over the years, I have firmly believed: our earthly father may leave us, but our Heavenly Father will always walk with us.

### • Reconciliation

When my father left his hometown, he carried resentment toward my grandmother, believing that she had acted improperly during his childhood—when she herself was a young widow. Over the years, he never called her “Mother” and never spoke directly to her. Even when he returned to visit with my sister, he said nothing, only allowing the child to call her “Grandmother.”

When we learned of his terminal illness, my grandmother was at our house. Though aged and gray-haired, she could not bear to see a white-haired person lose her son. After much internal deliberation, my grandmother and my aunt decided to leave for Zhecheng. The moment of departure was heavy with silence and tension. Words were unspeakable; everyone’s hearts were full of sorrow and reluctance.

As my aunt helped my grandmother leave, my grandmother bid a final farewell to my father. My father’s eyes filled with tears; his voice choked as he whispered, “Mom!” Grandmother wept, trembling, and tightly held her son’s hand. Mother and son embraced, crying silently, their tears pouring like a river, washing away years of estrangement and bitterness. In that moment, they reconciled through tears and embraced what had been unsaid for so many years.

On the way to Zhecheng with my cousin, we spoke of past grievances. She said heavily, “My mother never called your grandmother ‘Mom,’ because she believed that your grandmother had acted improperly in her younger years.” Hearing this, I was struck—my grandmother had silently endured immense pain all those years. In that harsh era, as a widow raising two children alone, her survival was already a struggle. How could she bear the loneliness and coldness imposed by her children on top of that? Who truly understood or shared the nearly unbearable sorrow in her life?

That night, I confronted my aunt: “Before grandmother passed, did you reconcile with her? Did you call her ‘Mom’ directly?” She whispered: “I never did while she was alive.”

She continued, “I closed my eyes, heart in agony, feeling the pain of years of silence. But once, before God, I confessed completely. I walked down the street, crying and shouting, calling out, ‘Mom!’”

In that moment, her guilt, grief, and remorse transformed into tears. Before God, she surrendered all long-held resentment and regrets.

Thanks be to the Lord—through Christ, all was reconciled. The ties between my father and grandmother, between my father and himself, were released by God’s mercy and grace; my aunt, in Christ, reconciled with her mother and herself.

This moment was not merely the revival of familial love but a spiritual rebirth through faith. The wounds once buried in our hearts gradually healed through God’s love; the bitterness once unspoken was dissolved in the light of the cross, replaced by understanding, forgiveness, and peace.

### • Reunion Meal

That noon, when leaving Luoyang, my aunt and church brothers and sisters warmly welcomed us for a meal. During the meal, we shared God’s grace and truth, speaking with gratitude and peace.

During lunch, my aunt again recounted stories about my father. She said, “Your father boarded the wrong train that year and ended up in Shenyang. He had originally planned to go to Luoyang to look for your uncle (my aunt’s husband). By the time he arrived at a distant relative’s home in Shenyang, he was starving. In desperation, he opened their food cupboard, hoping to find a steamed bun to eat, but instead he was scolded by the family.”

I replied, “It’s time to let go. Everyone suffered back then; every family lived a hard life. All of this was under God’s control. We need not dwell on others’ shortcomings.”

I continued, “If my father had not boarded that wrong train, we wouldn’t have his experiences in Heilongjiang-my birthplace. Without that, our whole family would not have come to faith, and I wouldn’t have been called to serve the Lord in the United States.”

At that moment, I realized clearly: what appears to humans as accident, error, or suffering, in God’s sovereignty and grace, becomes a pathway leading to salvation and mission.

### • Looking Up in Faith

Amid the vast sea of humanity, we may feel like a fragile boat at the mercy of the waves. Yet the Lord who created heaven and earth guides our hearts in the hidden currents of history, leading us step by step to His salvation.

Our greatest blessing is that our family is progressively walking toward the cross—grandmother believed before her passing, father came to faith, my aunt and mother, my siblings, in-laws, nephews, and our extended family in the U.S.—all follow Christ.

From now on, we boldly declare: “As for me and my household, we will serve the LORD forever!”(Joshua 24: 15)

The torrents of history once carried countless grievances and disputes, but they have now passed. When we lift our eyes to Christ, whose hands were nailed to the cross, we see not judgment, but the call of love; not accusation, but forgiveness; not hatred, but healing.

Farewell, my old home in Henan.

Thank you for raising my grandfather and shaping my father.

Whether in suffering or in blessing, we maintain hearts of gratitude and reverence toward God.

This visit to the tomb has not been in vain.

If not for the love of the cross, we could not understand it all;

If not for the hope of resurrection in Christ, we would have no strength to continue forward. (The End)

“Through Jesus, therefore, let us continually offer to God a sacrifice of

praise—the fruit of lips that openly profess his name.”

寻根之旅

（接上文）

### •    记忆中的父亲

在童年的记忆中，父亲性情孤僻，脾气暴躁。从我记事起，每天清晨灌入耳中的，几乎都是父亲和母亲不断的争吵声。

父亲一生都在与命运抗争，却似乎从未真正战胜过命运。他始终想摆脱贫困的阴影，带全家走向富足；总想离开农村，到城市做生意，成就一番事业，却屡试屡败。他生不逢时，志向与现实不断碰撞。也许正是出于对现实的无奈，或对自己怀才不遇的失落，在我的记忆里，父亲从未真正开怀大笑过。

不幸中的万幸是，父亲认识了上帝。母亲在1990年开始参加教会活动时，父亲十分支持她。他常说：“我从古书里早就知道，基督教的上帝是真神，和中国人拜的那些所谓的‘神’不一样。祂就是咱们常说的‘老天爷’，独一无二，大有能力。”

我生病时，父亲带领全家跪地祷告，坚信除了上帝，没有人能医治我。

当家里的生活刚刚有所好转，一场突如其来的灾难降临了。家里养的一头母牛，带着一头小牛，肚子里还怀着一头，一夜之间全被人偷走。父亲四处寻找，却毫无结果。他急火攻心，身体迅速垮了下来。医生诊断：肝癌，恐怕时日无多。

得知诊断结果后，父亲强烈要求教会的长老来为他施洗。他说：“我活着时被魔鬼败坏，没享过什么福；我死了一定要跟着上帝走。”

父亲的信救了他。为他施洗的长老和同工，亲自来为父亲裁制装老衣裳。衣服做好后，长老感慨地说：“这老头留不住了。布料和线正正好好，一点都没剩下。”（注：长老的话反映了中国文化中，一些发生的事情常被视为将要发生之事的象征或预兆。这里仅为事实陈述，不应作为基督徒信心操练的依据。）

受洗后不到一周，父亲便平安离世。生病期间，他虽有不适，却并未承受剧烈疼痛，生活仍能自理，甚至每天还能下地走走，直到生命的最后一天下午。

1996年8月20日（星期二）：他躺在东北的炕上，不断呢喃：“穿鞋，给我穿鞋！打开窗户，我要出去！”

### 十七岁的我异常冷静，立刻明白：父亲是要穿装老衣裳了，他的灵魂要被上帝接走了。

我催促家人，迅速为他换上那套洁白、绣着十字架的装老衣服，戴好帽子，穿上鞋。村里的老人来支持。家人轮流守在他身边。夜深了，心里一片凄凉。我们一家人咀嚼着生离死别的痛。

凌晨一点左右，父亲忽然要吃东西。母亲以为父亲好转，其实那只是生命最后一息前的回光返照。父亲吃完后，便安然断了气。

父亲去世前的那个主日，我正在教会讲道，读到《约翰福音》14章1–3节：“你们心里不要忧愁……我去原是为你们预备地方去。”那段经文仿佛预示了即将发生的一切，也给了我内心深处极大的平安。

追思礼拜那天，教会来了许多人。唱诗班身着洁白圣服，为父亲唱诗送行。长老讲道时说：“在人看来，父亲似乎还没完成任务——孩子们尚未成家；但上帝自有安排，已经为他预备了永恒的家”。

父亲被安葬在元宝山脚下，山清水秀。村里的长辈们帮忙操办丧事，我们兄妹三人随亲人一同送他最后一程。

父亲的离世给全家、尤其给母亲带来了巨大创痛。男人是女人的山，父亲走了，母亲的山倒了。我在送葬的哭声中，听出了母亲内心的绝望与无助。然而，“上帝在祂的圣所作孤儿的父，作寡妇的伸冤者”（诗68:5）。教会弟兄姐妹的关怀，深深抚慰了我们的心。

秋天将尽，必须在大雪前抢收玉米。没有父亲，家里的农活根本干不完。新华教会的弟兄姐妹来到我家帮忙，两天之内就把玉米全部收进了仓里。这么多年来，我始终坚信的是：肉身的父亲会离我们而去，但天上的父亲却会一直与我们相伴相随。

### •    和解

父亲离开老家时，心中始终对奶奶耿耿于怀，觉得奶奶年轻时有不当之处。许多年过去了，他从未管奶奶叫“妈妈”，也不曾正面与她说话。即使后来他带着姐姐回老家探望奶奶，他也与她一言不发，只是让孩子叫她“奶奶”。

得知父亲癌症晚期时，奶奶正在我们家里。她年事已高，白发苍苍，但怎能忍心看到白发人送黑发人呢？奶奶和大姑在内心深处权衡了许久，终于决定带奶奶离开黑龙江。离别的前一刻，家里充满了无尽的沉默和压抑的情绪。千言万语涌上心头，却难以开口，每个人的心里都充满了难过与不舍。

当大姑搀扶着奶奶准备离开家时，奶奶与父亲作了最后的告别。父亲泪水盈眶，声音哽咽，颤抖着低声说：“妈！”

奶奶老泪纵横，颤抖着伸出手，紧紧握住父亲的手。母子俩抱头痛哭，泪水无声地交汇，像河流般倾泻而下，湿透了衣襟，也冲刷着心中多年的隔阂与怨恨。这一刻，他们用泪水和拥抱完成了多年来无法言说的和解。

这次与大表姐一同前往柘城的路上，聊起上一辈人的恩恩怨怨。大表姐沉重地说：“我妈从来不管我姥姥叫妈，因为觉得我姥年轻时做过不当之事。”

听到这里，我心头一震——原来，多年来，奶奶承受着何等巨大的痛苦。在那个残酷的年代，她孤身一人，作为一位寡妇，带着一双儿女，生存本已举步维艰，她又该如何熬过那样的日子？而在此之后，她那颗被孤立、被冷落的心，还要默默承受一对儿女对她的疏远与冷淡。究竟又有谁，真正理解过、分担过她生命中那份几乎无法承受的孤独与哀伤呢？

那天晚上，我直面姑姑，郑重地问她：“在奶奶离开世界前，您是否与她和好？您当面叫我奶奶‘妈’了吗？”

### 姑姑低声说：“她活着时，我一直没有叫她妈。”

她接着说：“我闭上眼睛，心如刀绞，感受那多年未曾开口的痛楚。但有一次，我在神面前彻底认罪。我走在大街上，哭着、喊着、走着，一路呼喊着：‘妈！’”

这一刻，她心中的愧疚、悲痛、悔恨全都化为泪水。她在神面前，将所有埋藏多年的怨恨与遗憾交托给祂。

感谢主，在基督里，一切得以和解。父亲与奶奶之间、父亲与自己的心结，都在上帝的怜悯与恩典中得以释放；大姑也在基督里，与奶奶、与自己完成了心灵的和解。

这一刻，不只是亲情的复苏，更是信仰带来的心灵重生——那些曾经深埋在心底的伤痕，因上帝的慈愛而渐渐平复；那些曾经无法言说的怨恨，也在十字架的光中消解，成为理解、包容与平安。

### •    团圆饭

在离开洛阳的那个中午，大姑教会的弟兄姐妹热情地招待我们共进午餐。席间，大家一同分享主里的恩典与真理，言谈之间满有感恩与平安。

在午餐过程中，大姑再次提起父亲当年的往事。她说：“你爸爸当年上错了火车去了沈阳。他原本打算去洛阳找你大姑父的。等他到了沈阳那个远房亲戚家时，已经饿得不行了。他急忙打开人家的碗架子，想找点膜吃，结果却被那户人家骂了一顿。”

听到这里，我对大姑说：“该释怀了！当时人人都难，每一家日子都过得很苦。这一切都在神的掌管之中。我们不再提说人家的不好了。”

我继续说：“若不是父亲当年上错了那趟火车，就不会有他后来在黑龙江——我出生地的故事；若没有他在黑龙江的经历，也不会有我们全家信主的今天；更不会有我后来蒙召、到美国服侍主的一系列经历……”

那一刻，我心里格外清楚地知道：在人看来是偶然、是差错、甚至是苦难的经历，在上帝的主权与恩典之中，却一步一步连成了一条通向救恩与使命的道路。

### •    信仰的仰望

茫茫人海之中，人仿佛是无法掌控自己的一叶扁舟；然而，那位创造天地的主，却始终在历史的暗流中引导人心，使人一步一步走向祂的救恩。

最蒙福的是，我们一家的人，正在一个一个地走向十字架——奶奶生前信主了，父亲信主了，姑姑信主了，妈妈信主了，姐姐、哥哥、嫂子、外甥，以及我们在美国的全家，都信主了。

从今以后，我们要大声宣告：“至于我和我家，我们世世代代必定事奉耶和华！”（书24：15）

历史的洪流曾裹挟着无数的恩怨与是非，如今却早已逝去。当我们抬头仰望那位双手钉在十字架上的基督时，看见的不是审判，而是愛的召唤；不是追责，而是饶恕；不是仇恨，而是医治。

再见了，河南老家。

谢谢你，养育了我的爷爷，也塑造了我的父亲。

无论是苦，还是福，我们都存着向上帝的感恩与敬畏之心。

这一次扫墓，不虚此行。

若不是十字架的愛，我们无法理解这一切；

若不是基督里复活的盼望，我们也无力继续前行。（全文完）
