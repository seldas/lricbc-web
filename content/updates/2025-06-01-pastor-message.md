Practicing Gratitude, Part 2

Scripture Reading: 1 Thessalonians 5:18, Jonah 4:6

It’s easy to notice the good around you when things are going well. It can be harder to practice gratitude when things go poorly.

And yet, that’s exactly when you need to connect with God. When life is tough, you need God more than ever.

1 Thessalonians 5:18 says that Christ’s will for you is to give thanks “in all circumstances.” How can you give thanks when things are hard? It may take venting your hurt or frustration to God before you can get to gratitude.

Jesus himself suffered. If you’re suffering, start there with Jesus. Then ask God what you can be grateful for.

You may find many good things springing to mind. Even the thought that Jesus sees you and cares for you can be encouraging.

When the prophet Jonah was having a terrible day at work, he found gratitude by looking at God’s provision through the physical environment. God made a bush for shade and “Jonah was very happy about the bush.” (Jonah 4:6).

### Practice:

Think about a current hardship you face. Tell God truthfully how you feel about it. Share every lament and complaint.

Ask yourself: is there anything I can be grateful for in this circumstance?

Notice anything in your natural environment that feels like a gift from God.

Anytime you feel your shoulders sink today, ask Jesus to share in your suffering. Then ask: is there anything I can be grateful for? What has God done here that’s good?

Prayer: God, you know my heart. Thank you for hearing my suffering. Help me thank you in all circumstances.

操练感恩二

### 阅读经文：帖撒罗尼迦前书 5:18，约拿书 4:6

当你诸事顺利的时候，很容易察觉周围美好的事物。当你行事不顺，操练感恩就会更困难。

然而，这正是你最需要与神连接的时候。人生艰难时，你比任何时候都更需要神。

帖撒罗尼迦前书 5:18 说，基督向你所定的旨意是“凡事”谢恩。当你经历困难时，该如何谢恩呢？在你能感恩之前，可能要先向神倾诉你的伤痛和挫败。

耶稣自己也经历过苦难。如果你正在经历苦难，就从思想耶稣开始。然后求问神你可以为何感恩。

你可能会发现许多美好的事情跃入脑海。即使只是想到耶稣看顾和关爱你，也会令人鼓舞。

当先知约拿在服事中经历糟糕的一天，他从现实中看到了神的供应，并因此感恩。神安排一棵植物为他遮荫，“约拿因这棵蓖麻大大喜乐”（约拿书 4:6）。

### 操练：

思考你目前面临的困难。诚实地告诉神你的感受。分享每一个哀伤和埋怨。

问自己，在这个处境中有什么是我可以感恩的？

察觉自然环境中，有什么感觉像是来自神的礼物。

每当你感到不堪重负，求耶稣分担你的苦楚。然后问：有什么是我可以感恩的？神在这里成就什么美好的事？

### 祷告：

神啊，祢了解我的心。感谢祢聆听我的痛苦。帮助我凡事谢恩。
