**4/13/25 Pastor’s Word**
Santi’s Testimony

On December 21, 2024, while our church was holding gospel signs and evangelizing at a Chinese supermarket, a Filipino brother in Christ saw us and was deeply moved. The next day, during our Christmas celebration, he came specifically to our church to join the celebration. Since then, he has often sent me his personal devotionals. His testimony is as follows:

“My name is Santiago Lalis, but my friends call me Santi. I was born of the 11 siblings of one of the poorest families in one of the remotest areas in Southern Philippines. My parents were farmers (sharecroppers). My father was orphaned from an early age. He and his 2 siblings grew up with relatives who never sent them to school. My mother grew up taking care of a blind mother who did not have resources to send her to school either. My parents were denied inheritance from both sides. My parents had to buy 1/2 acre of barren land from my mother’s uncle so we could build a little hut and to have a little space for our animals to roam around. At age 5, I was already helping in the field and at the same time trying to avail myself of the basic free public education offered in the community. I remember our family had a rough time growing up, we could hardly meet both ends meet. Despite of the hardship I encountered, however, through the help of our almighty God, I graduated on top of my class in 1958! But then, I could not enroll in high school because of extreme poverty! I had to stop 6 years trying to find help even to the extent of writing to our congressman but to no avail. And when I found out the inherent impossibility, I had to run away to Manila, the capital city of the Philippines and ended up washing dishes in a marketplace little restaurant that caters food for early shoppers. I was able to enroll at Manila high night school, but I had to wash dishes for 15 hours. My high school journey was even tougher, I could not read books or use the library because of the limited time. I had to memorize everything the teachers taught inside the classroom to stay combative! And you what? It worked for me! Our almighty God let me graduate again on top of my class in 1968! After graduating as a Valedictorian, I was free to enroll in any university of my choice and the rest was my story!

In my quest to enjoy the free educational opportunities offered to me when I graduated Valedictorian, I was focused on serious studies without knowing that I did not enjoy having a girlfriend. My best friend in the college of law who was a Prosecutor in the city of Manila at the time, introduced me to the cousin of his wife named Rose who happened to be a Registered Nurse recruited by Baptist Medical Center in 1972, who was still single at the time. We exchanged communication by letters and eventually got married in Manila when we met for this first time, during her vacation to the Philippines in 1985! When she came back to the States, she petitioned me and 6 months later I joined her in Arkansas! Our marriage happened without a long courtship! Both of us didn’t plan about it! To me this is another miracle from God! My wife and I don’t have any children, but we are blessed to have a lot of nephews and nieces, some of them grew up in our house!

I remember, growing up in that tiny village, because of our extreme poverty, no one could expect that one of the 11 siblings could go to high school. But our almighty God is a God of Miracle! He can move mountains to show us His power! Who would ever think I could become a “Born Again Christian”? I thought all along I was already a good Christian and did not have to be “born again”, only to find out, among other things, that

1. There is a big difference between Christianity and religion.

2. That the issue is not religion but Jesus Christ!

And finally, 3. That unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he or she cannot enter the Kingdom of God (John 3:5)! I responded to the call of Evangelist Billy Graham during his crusade here in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1989 and since then, I believe I have been a “Born Again Christian”!

I began my journey as a licensed lawyer in the Philippines before immigrating to the U.S., where I started working as a server at the former Holiday Inn West in Little Rock, Arkansas. In 1986, I was honored to be voted as the First Employee of the year. At that time, I juggled three jobs: Waiter at Holiday Inn, Waiter at Little Rock Hilton, and Realtor in between shifts.

Later, I transitioned into real estate full-time while also attending nursing school. Eventually, I became a Registered Nurse at Baptist Medical Center. During this period, I was also named co-winner of the “My Everest” challenge for climbing thousands of steps—from ground to 10th floor and back—during my break times while on duty as a nurse. One special highlight: I had the opportunity to take a photo with the future 42nd President of the United States, who was then serving as Governor of Arkansas.

Now I am 81-year-old. I extremely boast my almighty God for navigating my life this far! It’s not about me, it’s all about Him! I have grown much by numbers but feel much richer and even much younger in heart and spirit! This is my story—an illustration of life watered by tears of sufferings and perseverance, a veritable saga of human survival against seemingly insurmountable odds. Summing it all up, my overcoming the hardships and successes both in schools and workplaces was designed and ordered by the Lord. I did not do it “my way” as I claimed before. It was all through God’s grace! May the readers be able to learn something of what I have been through. I am extremely grateful for all the adversities which have crossed my path for they have taught me tolerance, sympathy, self-control, perseverance, sagacity and all other virtues I might never have known!”

Thoughts of the Day—by Santi Lalis on 4/6, 2025

Some Bible Verses for all of us to Memorize, Meditate, and put into Practice all the days of our lives:

1. Proverbs 3:5-6: This verse encourages us to RELY SOLEY on GOD’S WISDOM and GUIDANCE, rather than on our own, in ALL ASPECTS of LIFE!

2. Isaiah 41:10: This verse offers comfort and assurance, reminding us that God is always present to support us, especially in times of troubles and difficulties!

3. Psalm 23: This passage is a beautiful expression of God’s care and provisions, describing Him as a shepherd who guides and protects His flocks! Consider reading this passage slowly and reflecting on the imagery and promises it contains!

4. John 3:16: This is a “foundational” verse for all Christians, emphasizing God’s love and the gift of salvation that can be obtained only through faith in Jesus Christ!

5. Matthew 11:28: This verse offers comfort and invites those who are struggling to find relief that can be found only in Jesus Christ!

6. Philippians 4:6-7: Key Takeaways on Philippians 4:6-7:

1) Replace fear and anxiety with prayer! Meaning, instead of dwelling on worries, we are encouraged to pray and express our needs to God!

2) God’s peace as a protector: God’s peace is presented as a powerful force that guards believers’ hearts and minds!

3) Trust in Christ: The assurance of our peace is tied up to our faith with Christ Jesus!

7. Romans 8:28: This verse assures believers that God is working for their good even in difficult circumstances! We need to be sure, however, that our love for God is demonstrated through obedience to His Word and aligning our will with God’s will in order to experience the fullness of this promise!

8. Joshua 1:9: This verse encourages us to be strong and courageous knowing that our God will be with us whatever we do, wherever we go! Have a blessed day everybody! May our almighty God guide, protect, and bless us all always!

This Saturday, April 19, our church will once again go to the entrance of the Chinese supermarket to hold gospel signs. We pray that the Lord will lead us to meet more brothers in Christ like Santi, so that we may encourage and serve one another. More importantly, we pray that the Lord would use us to proclaim and share His gospel with people from every nation and every people group. In the name of Christ, Amen!

2024年12月21日，我们教会在华人超市门口举牌传福音时，一位菲律宾的主内弟兄看到我们很感动。第二天，在我们举行圣诞庆祝时，他特地来到教会参与圣诞庆祝。从那以后，他常常把他写的灵修发给我。他的见证如下：

我的名字是 Santiago Lalis，朋友们叫我 Santi。我出生在菲律宾南部最偏远地区之一的一个极度贫穷的家庭，是11个兄弟姐妹中的一员。我的父母是佃农。我的父亲很小就成了孤儿，他和两个兄弟姐妹是由亲戚抚养长大，但这些亲戚从未让他们上学。我的母亲从小照顾她失明的母亲，也因为没有资源而未能上学。我的父母在双方家族中都没有继承任何财产。他们不得不从我母亲的舅舅那里买下半英亩的贫瘠土地，以便能搭建一座小屋，并让我们的家畜有一点活动空间。

我五岁时就已经开始帮忙下田，同时尽可能接受社区提供的免费基础教育。我记得我们家在我成长过程中非常艰难，几乎无法维持生计。尽管如此，在全能上帝的帮助下，我还是在1958年以班级第一名的成绩毕业！但由于极端的贫困，我无法升入高中。我不得不停学六年，一直在寻找帮助，甚至写信给国会议员，但始终没有回应。当我意识到几乎没有希望时，我只好离家出走，前往菲律宾首都马尼拉，最后在一个为早市顾客供应餐点的小餐馆里洗碗。我设法就读于马尼拉夜校高中，但我每天得工作15个小时洗碗。高中生活更加艰难，我没有时间看书，也无法利用图书馆，只能在课堂上把老师讲的内容全部背下来！你猜怎么着？这方法真的对我奏效了！在全能上帝的帮助下，我又一次以全班第一的成绩毕业，于1968年成为毕业致词代表。之后，我可以自由申请任何大学，接下来的故事，就是我人生的延续！

在我努力把握毕业时作为毕业致词代表（Valedictorian）所获得的免费教育机会的过程中，我一心专注于学习，几乎没有意识到自己其实并不渴望拥有女朋友。当时我在法学院最好的朋友，正担任马尼拉市的检察官，他向我介绍了他妻子的表妹——名叫Rose，她是一位注册护士，早在1972年就被美国的浸信会医疗中心（Baptist Medical Center）招募到美国工作，那时她仍是单身。我们通过书信联系，最终在1985年她回菲律宾度假期间第一次见面，并在马尼拉结婚！她回到美国后，为我递交了担保申请，六个月后我就来到了阿肯色州与她团聚！我们的婚姻几乎没有长时间的恋爱过程，双方也都没有提前规划这一切！对我来说，这又是上帝所赐的一个神迹！我和妻子没有亲生孩子，但我们非常蒙福，有许多侄子侄女，其中一些是在我们家中长大的！

我记得，在那个贫穷的小村庄成长时，因为家境实在太差，没有人会相信我们11个孩子中会有人能上高中。但我们的全能神是行神迹的神！祂能移山来彰显祂的能力！谁能想到我会成为一个“重生的基督徒”？我一直以为自己已经是一个好基督徒，不需要“重生”。直到我明白了一些重要的事：

基督信仰与宗教之间有着极大的区别。

问题不在于宗教，而在于耶稣基督！

### 人若不是从水和圣灵生的，就不能进神的国（约3:5）！

1989年，我在阿肯色州小石城参加葛培理布道大会时回应了呼召，从那时起，我相信我成为了一位“重生得救的基督徒”！

我在菲律宾是一名注册律师，后来移民到美国，开始在阿肯色州小石城的前Holiday Inn West宾馆做服务员。1986年，我被评为“年度第一员工”。那时我同时做着三份工作：在Holiday Inn做服务员，在Little Rock Hilton也做服务员，之间还兼职做房地产经纪。

后来我转为全职做房地产，同时攻读护理专业，最终成为了Baptist Medical Center的注册护士。在那段时间，我还在工作间隙参与了“我的珠穆朗玛”挑战赛，反复从地面爬到十楼又下楼，最终成为共同获奖者。我生命中一个特别的时刻，是我有机会与后来成为美国第42任总统的那位——当时的阿肯色州州长——合影留念。

如今我已经81岁了。我极度自豪地夸耀我的全能神，是祂引领我走到今天！这不是关于我，而是关于祂！虽然我的年纪增长了，但我的心灵却更加年轻、更加富足！这就是我的故事——一段被苦难与坚韧之泪浇灌的生命旅程，是一个在人类几乎无法逾越的困难中生存下来的真实写照。总而言之，我在学业和职场中所经历的一切困难与成功，都是主所安排与设计的。我以前说是“靠我自己走过来”，但其实全都是靠神的恩典！

愿读者们能从我经历的点滴中得着一点启发。我为我人生中所遇到的所有困境感恩，因为正是这些困境教会了我宽容、同情、自制、坚忍、智慧，以及许多我原本不会知道的美德！”

每日灵修 ——Santi Lalis，2025年4月6日

### 以下是一些我们每天都可以背诵、默想并在生活中实践的经文：

箴言3:5-6：这节经文鼓励我们完全依靠上帝的智慧和引导，而不是依靠自己的聪明，无论在生活的哪个方面。

以赛亚书41:10：这节经文给我们带来安慰和确据，提醒我们：神总是在我们遭遇困难时扶持我们！

诗篇23篇：这段经文美丽地表达了神的看顾和供应，把祂描绘成牧人，引导和保护祂的羊群。建议你慢慢地读，并默想其中的意象与应许。

约翰福音3:16：这是所有基督徒的“根基经文”，强调神的爱以及藉着信靠耶稣基督才能得着的救恩。

马太福音11:28：这节经文为正在受苦的人带来安慰，指出唯有在耶稣基督里，我们才能找到真正的安息。

### 腓立比书4:6-7：这一段经文的重点包括：

1）用祷告取代恐惧与焦虑：当我们忧虑时，应当祷告并向神陈明我们的需要；（2）神的平安会保守我们：神的平安是一种能力，能够保守信徒的心怀意念；（3）信靠基督是关键：我们的平安来源于我们与耶稣基督之间的信心关系。

罗马书8:28：这节经文确保我们，即便在苦难中，神仍为爱祂的人预备最好的。我们必须通过顺服神的话语并让自己的意愿与神的旨意对齐，才能真正经历这应许的丰满。

约书亚记1:9：这节经文鼓励我们要刚强壮胆，因为无论我们做什么，去到哪里，神都与我们同在！愿你们大家都度过一个蒙福的日子！愿我们全能的神一直引导、保守并赐福我们每一个人！

我们教会将于4月19日（周六）再次前往华人超市门口举牌传福音。我们祷告主引领我们，能遇见更多像Santi这样的主内弟兄姐妹，彼此激励、彼此服事。更重要的是，愿主使用我们，将祂的福音传扬给万国万民！奉基督之名，阿们！
