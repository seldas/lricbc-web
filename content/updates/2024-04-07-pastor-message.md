见证之日The Day of Testimonies

“Glad in heart, joyful in spirit, peacefully dwelling in the flesh”:

Easter Celebration in the Church

Over three thousand years ago, the Holy Spirit prophesied through the mouth of David, saying: “because you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead, nor will you let your faithful one see decay” (Psalm 16:10). Around the year 30 AD, Peter confirmed during Pentecost that our ancestor David had died, been buried, and his tomb was still there. David was not speaking about himself, but about the resurrection of Jesus, as Jesus’ soul was not abandoned to Sheol, and his body did not see corruption (Acts 2:29-32). Jesus has risen! His resurrection conquered death, the grave, and the devil, granting new life to those who believe in him. The Church celebrates Easter to witness the resurrection power of the Lord Jesus Christ transcending time and space and to share the good news of the gospel with others. This year, everyone in the church is filled with joy during the Easter celebration. Here are a few points to share with our brothers and sisters in the Lord:

### • Blessed by God

The celebration consists of two parts: indoor worship and outdoor worship and activities. Regarding outdoor worship and activities, we want to express special thanks to God for the weather He has provided. Previously, there were concerns about the hot weather, and tents were prepared for shade. However, God prepared a heavenly canopy with clouds for us, providing pleasant weather, and everyone’s mood was comfortable.

### • Via Dolorosa Candlelight Meditation

Without Christ’s suffering, there would be no resurrection. Last Friday evening, the church held a “Fourteen Stations of the Via Dolorosa Candlelight Meditation” for Good Friday. The Via Dolorosa is a 600-meter-long stone road in the old city of Jerusalem, believed to be the route Jesus took to be crucified. The Latin term “Via Dolorosa” means “the sorrowful way.” Traditionally, people divided this way into fourteen stations, marking the suffering Jesus endured. Through candlelight meditation, we immersed ourselves in the scene, reflecting deeply on the sufferings endured by the Lord and our own sins through songs, scripture recitations, prayers, a short video of “The Passion of the Christ,” and prayers. Many brothers and sisters were deeply moved.

### • Pre-taste of Heaven

One of the characteristics of the scenes in Revelation is “After this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands” (Revelation 7:9). This year, our Chinese church and the Antioch Church (an English-speaking church that shares the same building with us but meets in different areas) jointly celebrated Easter outdoors. We sang English hymns, listened to English messages with Chinese translation, and partook in the Lord’s Supper together. This unity was a testimony to the life of oneness that Christ’s resurrection has bestowed upon us.

### • Unity in Service

“How good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity!” (Psalm 133:1). The celebration was pleasant, brothers and sisters loved one another, and served one another. There were beautiful worship, delicious barbecue and various delicacies, children hunted for Easter eggs, played on jumping house, enjoyed ice smoothies, and everyone exchanged greetings and conversations. This was the result of teamwork in service. The morning prayer team prayed daily in preparation for Easter, and brothers and sisters actively invited friends through WeChat messages and word of mouth. Particularly grateful were those who prepared barbecue skewers on Saturday. Such enthusiasm for the Lord is pleasing! Everyone shares a common desire: to let more people feel the love of God and the warmth of brothers and sisters!

### • Children’s Resurrection Bags

Handcrafted Easter bunnies and other crafts made by Sister Mingfang were children’s favorites. This year, she made exquisite bags embroidered with crosses for 59 children. As elders distributed gifts to the children, they explained the meaning of believing in Jesus to each child, sowing the seeds of the gospel in their young hearts. Mingfang had each child sign their bag as a memento and prayed for them one by one.

### • Joy Among the People

This Easter celebration had approximately over 200 attendees, making it the largest gathering in the history of our church. Many people who had never been to our church before joined us, giving us the opportunity to share the gospel with them. One seeker said, “This Easter event at the church was really good. Both adults and children were happy. The barbecue was so delicious, and I’m sure it took a lot of effort to prepare so many. Thank you for your hard work.” Another invited seeker couldn’t attend due to work schedule, but his wife came with their child. After the event, he actively asked for the church’s address and expressed his desire to make some contribution to the church. All of this is by the grace of God, and we give all glory to the Lord. Of course, there were also many shortcomings in our service. We are thankful to all co-workers for their valuable feedback, which will serve as valuable guidance for better service in the future.

David praised the Lord’s resurrection, saying, “Therefore, my heart is glad, and my whole being rejoices; my flesh also rests secure” (Psalm 16:9). May the life of the Lord’s resurrection continually fill us, so that we may live our lives with joy in our hearts, gladness in our spirits, and security in our bodies, always anchored in hope!

“心欢喜、灵快乐、肉身安然居住”

——记教会的复活节庆祝

约三千多年前，圣灵借大卫的口预言说：“因为你必不将我的灵魂撇在阴间，也不叫你的圣者见朽坏”（诗16：10）。约公元一世记30多年左右，彼得在五旬节讲道时证实，先祖大卫死了，埋葬了，他的坟墓还在。大卫所论及的不是他自己，而是指耶稣的复活，因为耶稣的灵魂没有被撇在阴间，耶稣的肉体没有见朽坏（徒2：29-32）。耶稣已经复活了！耶稣的复活战胜了死亡、阴间、坟墓和魔鬼，将全新的生命赐给信他的人。教会要庆祝复活节，见证主基督超越时空的复活大能，并与人分享福音的好消息。今年教会的复活节庆祝每个人的脸上都洋溢着喜乐。以下总结几点，与家人们分享。

* 蒙神赐福

庆祝分两个部分。一部分是室内敬拜；另一部分是室外敬拜与活动。关于室外敬拜与活动，我们要特别感谢上帝赐予的天气。之前大家比较担心天气炎热，本想准备遮荫的帐篷，结果上帝亲自用云彩为我们预备了属天的遮阴棚，天气宜人，大家心情舒畅。

* 十架苦路十四站默想

基督若不受苦，就没有复活。上周五受难节晚上，教会举行“十架苦路十四站烛光默想”。十架苦路（Via Dolorosa）是耶路撒冷旧城一条 600 米长的石路，人们相信这是耶稣被钉十字架的路线。 拉丁语 “Via Dolorosa” 的意思是“悲伤之路”（the sorrowful way）。   传统上，人们将这条路分成十四站，标记耶稣所走过的受苦之路。我们以烛光默想的形式，通过诗歌、经文诵读、祷词、受难短片、祈祷等形式，将自己带入场景中，深刻默想主为我们所受的一切苦以及我们自己的罪。许多弟兄姐妹深受受感动。

* 预尝天堂

《启示录》里天上场景的特点之一是“各国、各族、各民、各方的人” 一同站在宝座和羔羊面前敬拜（7：9）。今年我们中文教会和安提阿教会（Antioch Church，这间英文教会和我们在同一座教堂里的不同地方活动）在室外联合庆祝复活节，英文诗歌，英文信息、中文翻译，同领主餐（我们教会一位弟兄在2月26日受主感动曾为此祈祷，没想到主居然真的借着安提阿教会牧师的提议成就了这个愿望），向众人见证基督复活所赐的合一生命。

* 同工同心

“看啊，弟兄和睦同居，是何等的善、何等的美”（诗133：1）。庆祝场面热情，弟兄姐妹彼此相爱，互相搭配服侍。有美好的敬拜，可口的烧烤及各样美食，小朋友们捡复活彩蛋、玩蹦蹦床、吃沙冰，大家互相交流问候等。这是团队服侍的成果。晨祷会同工每日清晨为复活节的庆祝献上祈祷，预备人心；弟兄姐妹多次在微信上宣传，口口相传，积极邀请慕道朋友们参加。特别感恩的是，许多弟兄姐妹在周六就准备烧烤烤串。这份热心为主悦纳！大家都有一个共同的心愿：让更多人感受到上帝的慈愛和弟兄姐妹的热情！

*儿童复活袋

明芳阿姨亲手编织的复活节小兔子等手工艺品是小朋友的最愛。今年她为59位小朋友发了绣有十字架的精美小袋子。几位长辈给孩子们发礼物时，为每位小朋友讲信主的意义，将福音的种子播撒在每位幼小的心田里。她让每个小朋友签名留念，好为他们每个人提名代祷。

* 众民喜悦

这次复活节庆祝大概有200多人参加，是教会历史上参加人数最多的一次。许多从未来过教会的人都来到我们当中，使我们有机会和他们分享福音。有位慕道友说：“这次教会复活节活动办得真好，大人孩子都开心。肉串太好吃了，大家串那么多肉串肯定付出了好多功夫。辛苦你们了”。另一位受邀慕道朋友因值班无法参加，但他太太带孩子来了。会后，他受感主动索要教会地址，想为教会作奉献。这一切都是上帝的恩典，我们将荣耀归于主。当然，服侍中也有许多不足之处，感谢各位同工提出宝贵意见，为未来更好地服侍提供有价值的参考。

大卫称颂主复活时说：“因此，我的心欢喜，我的灵快乐，我的肉身也要安然居住”（诗16：9）。愿主复活的生命一直充满我们，使我们一生一世都心欢喜、灵快乐，肉身也安然居住在指望中！

周一到周五早5：00，周六早6：00。每次一个小时。周日没有。由弟兄姐妹轮流带领，欢迎弟兄姐妹参加。Zoom ID:501.501.7777,密码:777。
