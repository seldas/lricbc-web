**6/9/24 Pastor’s Word**
Martin Luther’s Preface to The Epistle to the Romans

(Continue from above)

Ch. 7—Dead to the Law

34. In the seventh chapter the apostle confirms this teaching by an illustration taken from married life. When a husband dies, his wife, too, becomes free, and each is released from the other. Not in this sense, that the woman is not to take another husband, but rather in this sense, that she is now truly free to take another, which she could not do before she became released from her former husband.

35. Likewise, under the sinful old man our conscience is bound to the Law; when he has been mortified by the Spirit, the conscience is free, and each is released from the other. Not in this sense, that henceforth it is to do nothing, but in the sense that it is now to cling truly to Christ, the other husband, and yield the fruit of life.

36. Continuing, the apostle expands his teaching concerning sins and the Law, and shows how sin begins to become quite active and grow powerful through the Law. For the old man becomes more incensed against the Law, because he cannot pay what the Law demands. For sin is his nature, and of himself he cannot but sin. Therefore, the Law is his (instrument of) death, and inflicts on him all manner of torment. Not that the Law is evil, but the person’s evil nature cannot tolerate what is good, and that good is required of him, just as a sick person cannot bear that people ask him to run and leap like a hale person.

37. St. Paul, then, in this epistle, draws the conclusion that the Law, when correctly understood and fully comprehended, accomplishes no more than that it brings our sins to our remembrance, slays us by means of them, and makes us subject to the wrath everlasting. All this is well learned by the experience of our conscience when it has been fully smitten by the Law, and we find out that we must have something else, something better than the Law, to make us godly and to save us. But those who do not understand the Law correctly are blind. They strut about in their conceit and imagine that they can satisfy the Law by their works. For they do not know how much the Law demands, namely, a willing, cheerful heart. They do not look Moses straight in the eye; the veil is before them, and the meaning of the Law is hidden from them.

The Conflict Within the Believer

38. Next he shows how the Spirit and the flesh struggle with one another in an individual and offers himself as an example, to teach us the right understanding of this work of slaying sin in ourselves. He calls both the Spirit and the flesh a law; for as the nature of the divine Law is to urge and make demands, so the flesh in its struggle with the Spirit urges and makes demands and rages in an effort to achieve its desire. On the other hand, the Spirit keeps urging and makes demands in opposition to the flesh and wants to achieve His desire. This struggle lasts as long as we live; it is more violent in one person, less so in another, according as the Spirit or the flesh grows stronger. And yet the entire person is himself both Spirit and flesh, struggling with himself until he becomes altogether spiritual.

Ch. 8—Afflictions An Aid Against the Flesh

39. In the eighth chapter the apostle comforts these strugglers, telling them that their flesh does not condemn them. Furthermore, he shows what is the nature of the flesh and of the Spirit, and how the Spirit is derived from Christ, who has given us His Holy Spirit. This Spirit makes us spiritual, subdues the flesh, and assures us that as long as we follow the Spirit, resist sin, and endeavour to slay it, we are, nevertheless, the children of God, no matter how violently sin rages in us. How-ever, since nothing serves the purpose of bruising the flesh as well as crosses and sufferings, he comforts us in our sufferings by reminding us of the help afforded by the Spirit of love and by all creatures. He tells us that both the Spirit groans within us and all creatures are yearning with us for deliverance from the flesh and from sin. Thus we see that these three chapters, 6, 7, and 8, urge upon us this single work of faith which is called mortifying the old Adam and taming the flesh.               (to be continued)

马丁·路德的《罗马书》序言

（接上文）

第七章——向律法死

34. 在第七章中，使徒用婚姻生活中的一个例子证实了这一教义。当丈夫去世时，他的妻子获得自由，双方都从对方那里解脱出来。这并不是说女人不能再嫁，而是说她现在真正可以自由地再嫁，而这是她在摆脱前夫之前无法做到的。

35. 同样，在罪恶的旧人统治下，我们的良心也受律法的束缚；当他被圣灵制服后，良心就自由了，双方都从对方那里解脱出来。并不是说从此以后什么都不要做，而是说现在要真正地依附于基督，另一个丈夫，并结出生命的果实。

36. 接下来，使徒扩展了他关于罪恶和律法的教义，并展示了罪恶如何开始变得非常活跃，并通过律法变得强大。因为老我对律法更加愤怒，因为他无法满足律法的要求。罪恶是他的本性，他自己不能不犯罪。因此，律法是他的（致死工具），给他带来各种折磨。并不是说律法是邪恶的，而是人的邪恶本性不能容忍善，而善是需要他做的，就像一个病人不能忍受人们要求他像一个健康的人一样奔跑和跳跃。

37. 因此，圣保罗在这封书信中得出结论，当正确理解和充分领悟律法时，它所能做的不过是让我们想起我们的罪，用这些罪杀死我们，让我们遭受永恒的愤怒。当我们的良心被律法完全击倒时，通过我们的良心就会充分认识到这一切，我们发现我们必须有其他东西，比律法更好的东西，才能让我们变得虔诚并拯救我们。但是那些没有正确理解律法的人是盲目的。他们自以为是，自以为可以通过自己的行为满足律法。因为他们不知道律法所要求的就是一颗乐意、快乐的心。他们不直视摩西的眼睛；面纱就在他们面前，律法的含义对他们来说是隐藏的。

信徒内心的冲突

38. 接下来，他展示了圣灵和肉体如何在一个人身上相互斗争，并以自己为例，教导我们正确理解这种在我们自己身上消灭罪恶的工作。他称圣灵和肉体都是一种律；因为神圣律法的本质是敦促和提出要求，所以肉体在与圣灵的斗争中，为了实现它的愿望会敦促和提出要求，并愤怒不已。另一方面，圣灵不断敦促和提出要求，反对肉体，并希望实现他的愿望。只要我们活着，这种斗争就会持续下去；根据圣灵或肉体的力量，它在一个人身上更激烈，在另一个人身上则不那么激烈。然而，整个人本身既是灵又是肉体，与自己斗争，直到他完全成为灵性。

第八章——苦难是对抗肉体的帮助

39. 在第八章中，使徒安慰这些斗争者，告诉他们他们的肉体不会定他们的罪。此外，他还展示了肉体和圣灵的本质，以及圣灵是如何从基督那里衍生出来的，基督给了我们他的圣灵。圣灵使我们属灵，征服肉体，并向我们保证只要我们跟随圣灵、抵制罪恶，并努力消灭罪恶，我们便仍是上帝的孩子，无论罪恶在我们心中肆虐得多么猛烈。然而，由于没有什么比十字架和苦难更能伤害肉体，他通过提醒我们慈爱的圣灵和所有受造物所提供的帮助，来安慰遭受苦难中的我们。他告诉我们，圣灵在我们内心叹息，所有受造物都与我们一起渴望摆脱肉体和罪恶。因此，我们看到这三章，第 6、7 和 8 章，敦促我们做这项信仰的工作，即克制老亚当和驯服肉体。（未完待续）
