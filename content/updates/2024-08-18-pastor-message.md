Pouring Out Love in Taiwan: Remembering Ping Meng-hui

Note: Last week, I noticed many pastors and coworkers mentioning the name “Peng Meng-hui (彭蒙惠)” on social media. I asked Rev. &amp; Mrs. Ron West from our church, who served in Taiwan as missionaries for more than 30 years, if they knew her. Mrs. West said, “Yes, we knew her. A wonderful Godly woman. Her organization/ministry performed all over the island years and years. A wonderful Christian witness to schools and public.” Rev. Ron added: “Her TV English classes were very popular in Taiwan. Her Christian music group was famous in Taiwan and in many Asian countries. They would do tours in the US. She and Faye Pearson (my previous professor in Nanjing Seminary, https://lricbc.org/?p=1023) also knew each other well. I met her several times through the years.”

Doris Marie Brougham (Chinese Pinyin: Peng Meng-hui, Chinese name spelling: 彭蒙惠，August 5, 1926 - August 6, 2024) was an American educator and missionary. She was born in a German Christian family in Seattle and had 8 brothers and sisters. The call to China came at a summer Bible camp when she was 12. Chinese evangelist Ji Zhiwen asked the crowd of Americans, “Who would like to go to China and help the people there in their need?” As she raised her hand, the adults around her laughed, thinking that she had no idea what she was signing up for.

After graduating from the University of Washington in 1948 with a major in Far Eastern Studies, she faced her dream of becoming a trumpet player in the future with a full scholarship from the Eastman School of Music in New York. Psalm 2:8 came to her mind: “Ask me, and I will make the nations your heritage, the ends of the earth your possession.” Nations? The ends of the earth? Was this referring to China? Brougham hesitated. Finally, Brougham responded to God, “If you need me, I would go to the farthest ends of the earth for you.” So, she bid farewell to her parents and family, and took a 6-week ship from Seattle to Shanghai as a missionary. Coincidentally, during the Second Civil War in China, she fled to different cities with the mission team and fled to Hong Kong in 1949. After arriving in Taiwan in 1951, she immediately chose Hualien County on the east coast of Taiwan to serve. After two weeks there, her mother caught a serious cold, fell ill on Friday, and died on Sunday. At that time, both her father and mother were gone, and she was very sad. The Lord comforted her and said, “Don't worry, I will always protect you.” At that time, less than 1% of people believed in the Lord there. She prayed, and God gave her a word “Radio.” God inspired her to start the first gospel radio program in Hualien. She said, “Why don't you do the radio? Many people will listen to the radio. God said, why don’t you do it. You can do it, and I will help you. But I have never done it. So, God will help me.”

To reach people, Brougham learned, “You have to do something to get their attention. You have to connect with people, not just communicate with them.” To reach more people with the gospel, she founded Taiwan’s first Christian radio program in 1951. That same year, at a time when television was just beginning in Taiwan, there was only one TV station, and she had to compete with Buddhist and Catholic for exclusive religious program time slots. Because her programs (including children's choir, traditional music, choir singing, dramas, sermons, and her trumpet playing) always had music, the TV station chose her. She remembered people crowding around the then-rare TV sets in the temple to watch her sermons and choir singing programs. “How many opportunities do you have to preach in a Buddhist temple?” Brougham said. “God had planned this all.” The TV time slot cost them $1,000 a month, which was a heavy burden for them. Her salary was $200. But they kept praying, while God kept providing. One Saturday, they didn’t have any money. The accountant said we must pay the next Monday. She said, “Why do you worry? Today is only Saturday, and there are still two days.” As a result, on Sunday a Chinese from Canada donated 1,000 yuan. She said, “God doesn't want us to do anything for him, he just wants us to do what he wants us to do for him.”

In 1962, Brougham founded the “Studio Classroom” to spread the gospel. It was famous for publishing English learning magazines. She said: “We are not teaching English, we use English to see the world. We ask them to open their eyes. So many people around the world believe in Jesus because of Studio Classroom. I think God uses this English. Not because of English, but because we told people that you need English now, but you need Jesus more. So, English is a bridge.” In those days, she liked to ride her bicycle to the streets during the broadcast time of the program to listen to people in each household and temple listening to her program. Once, a nun called her and quietly asked her where to find the Bible. Seeing her success, Far Eastern Broadcasting Corporation invited her to develop more Chinese programs and broadcast them in mainland China.

In 1963, Brougham founded the Heavenly Melody, the first full-time Taiwanese gospel choir, and composed Chinese gospel songs to spread the gospel. She said: “In fact, God loves the Chinese the most because he has made so many Chinese.” She said: “If you do what God wants you to do, you will not regret it. You will be happy with it.” In an interview with CNA in 2023, she said, “I came here to serve because of God’s plan. I just thought about serving Him every day. Then a day turned into a few months, and then into a few years, and then wow! I am still here 72 years later!”

Brougham lights up people like a match. She still played trumpet in the Heavenly Melody shortly before her death. She said, “Can we retire? The Bible does not say that you can retire. I don’t want to retire, because the word retirement (‘退’) in Chinese means ‘backward’, we have to move forward.” She said, “Love never ends. We must see our responsibility in the needs of others.” She won numerous awards. She said, “Where the heart is, there is home, and my heart is here, Taiwan is my home.” On June 20, 2023, she was awarded a Taiwan passport by the then president. She said, “I am not worthy, I am just an ordinary person.” She often uses the passport to heaven as an analogy to invite people to believe in Jesus. One day after celebrating her birthday, she passed away at the age of 98. On her Facebook it is posted: “Doris graduated from this life and was promoted to Heaven on August 6 evening, Taipei time. We know she is joyfully playing her trumpet in God's great orchestra.” She was buried in the Christian Cemetery. She never married and had no property in her life. According to her will, her copyright and relics were donated to the Overseas Radio and Television. She is a Godly predecessor worthy of our emulation!

### 将愛播撒在台湾：追忆彭蒙惠

注：上周看到许多牧者和同工在社交平台上提到“彭蒙惠”这个名字。我问我们教会的魏牧师和师母（他们曾在台湾作宣教士30多年）是否认识她。魏师母说:  “是的，我们认识她。一个非常敬虔的姐妹。她的机构/事工多年来遍布全岛各地。她为学校和公众做了一个非常出色的基督徒见证。”魏牧师也说：“她的电视英语课在台湾很受欢迎。她的基督教音乐团体在台湾和许多亚洲国家都很有名。他们会在美国巡回演出。她和裴斐老师（英文名：Faye Pearson, 我以前在南京神学院的教授https://lricbc.org/?p=1023）也很熟悉。这些年来我见过她几次。”在此，特从网上搜集她的一些见证与弟兄姐妹分享。

彭蒙惠（英语：Doris Marie Brougham，1926年8月5日—2024年8月6日）是一位美国教育家和传教士。她出生于西雅图一个德裔基督教家庭，家中有8个兄弟姊妹。12岁那年的暑期圣经夏令营里，中国布道家计志文面向一群美国人问到：“有谁愿意去中国，帮助那里人民的需要？”小彭蒙惠举起了手。身旁的大人都笑了，认为她不知道自己在做什么。

1948年于美国华盛顿大学主修远东研究毕业后，面对纽约伊斯特曼音乐学院全额奖学金将来可能成为小喇叭演奏家的梦想，诗篇2:8浮现在她脑海中：“你求我，我就将列国赐你为产业，将地极赐你为田产。”列国？地极？这是指中国吗？彭蒙惠踌躇着。最后，她回应神：“如果祢需要我，我愿意为祢去到地球最远的地方”。于是，彭蒙惠告别父母家人，以传教士身分从西雅图搭乘6个星期的船到上海。适逢中国第二次内战，她随差会逃往不同城市，1949年逃至英属香港；1951年到台湾后，彭蒙惠随即选择台湾东岸花莲县服事。在那里两个礼拜后，她妈妈得严重感冒，礼拜五生病，礼拜天去世。那时，她爸爸妈妈都不在了，她很难过。主安慰她说：“你放心好了，我会一直保守你”。当时那里信主的人还不到1%。她祷告，神就给她一个字“Radio”（广播）。神感动她在花莲开始第一个福音广播节目。她说：“为什么不作广播，广播很多人会听。神就讲，为什么你不做。你可以做，我帮你做。但是我没有做过。所以，神会帮助我”。

彭蒙惠学习到，要接触人，“你必须做一些事情来吸引他们的注意，你必须与人有连结，而不只是与人有沟通。”为了将福音传给更多人，她在1951年创办台湾第一个基督教广播节目。同年，在台湾刚开始出现电视机的时期，台湾只有一家电视台，彭蒙惠需要与佛教和天主教竞争宗教节目独播的时段。她的节目（包括儿童诗班和传统音乐、诗班颂歌、戏剧、讲道，以及她的小号演奏）总是有音乐，所以电视台选择了她。她还记得人们挤在寺庙所拥有的当时罕见的电视机旁，观看她制作的讲道和诗班演唱节目。“你能有多少机会在佛教寺庙里布道呢？”彭蒙惠说，“上帝早已计划好这一切的发生。”那时电视台时段每个月要付1000美金，对他们是很大的负担。她的薪水是200块。但是他们一直祷告，神就不断供应。有一次，礼拜六他们还没有钱。会计说：“下周一要付钱”。她说：“你为什么着急，今天才礼拜六，还有两天呢”。结果礼拜天有一个从加拿大来的中国人奉献1000块。她说：“神不要我们为他做什么，他就是要我们为他做他要我们做的事”。

1962年她成立《空中英语教室》广传福音，并以发行英语学习杂志闻名。她说：“我们不是教英文，我们是用英文看这个世界。我们叫他们打开他们的眼睛。所以很多人在全世界因为空中英文教室信耶稣。我想神用这个英文。不是因为英文，是因为我们跟他讲，你现在需要英文，但你更需要耶稣。所以，英文作为一个桥梁”。当年，她喜欢在节目播出的时段骑脚踏车到街上，听听各家各户和寺庙里的人收听她的节目。有一次，有个尼姑打电话给她，悄悄地问她哪里可以找到圣经。看到她的成功，远东广播公司邀请她开发更多中文节目，并在中国大陆播放。

她1963年创立天韵合唱团——第一个全职台湾人福音合唱团，创作华语福音歌曲传递福音。 她说： “其实神最愛中国人，因为他做了那么多中国人”。她说：“你若做神要你做的事，你不会后悔。你会在其中得到快乐”。2023年她接受CNA访问时说，“我来这里服事全是上帝的带领，我只是每一天都想着要服事祂。然后一天变成几个月，再变成几年，还后哇！72年后我还在这里！”

彭蒙惠像火柴照亮人。她去世前不久还在天韵合唱团吹小号。她说：“我们可以退休吗？圣经没有说可以退休。我不要退，因为退是backward(落后)，我们要往前走。”她说：“愛永不止息。要在别人的需要上看到我们的责任”。她得过无数奖项。她说：“心在哪里，家就在哪里，而我的心在这，台湾就是我的家”。2023年6月20日，由时任总统授予她中华民国国籍护照。她说：“我很不配，我是非常平凡的人”。她常用天国的护照作比喻邀请人信耶稣。刚庆祝完生日后一天，她被主接回天家，享耆寿98岁。那天，她的脸书上发布：“彭蒙惠老师于台北时间8月6日傍晚人生毕业了！现在已加入天堂的乐团，继续快乐的吹奏小喇叭！” 她被葬于基督教墓园。她一生没有结婚，没有房产，按其遗嘱，将其著作权和遗物捐赠给救世传播协会。她是一位值得我们效法的属灵前辈！
