见证之日The Day of Testimonies

Psalm 118: 24 This is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.

The Day of Testimonies

Psalm 118: 24 This is the day the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.

On March 24, 2024, is a day worth commemorating for our church, because on this day, ten brothers and sisters gave their testimonies through baptism, and Wu Hong and Han Tao also gave their testimony through sharing God’s grace of receiving salvation and healing. This is the day appointed by God, a day of joy and gladness for all brothers and sisters.

### Firstly, the testimony of baptism:

Baptism is the most beautiful testimony given by believers to the Lord. It marks the beginning of the spiritual journey for Christians, not the end. Baptists believe that baptism, received by believers in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, is an act of obedience, symbolizing the believer’s faith in being crucified, buried, and raised with the Lord. Being immersed in water signifies the believer’s death to sin, the burial of the old self, and resurrection into a new life with Christ. Baptism is a testimony of faith in the resurrection of the dead in the last days.

The number of baptisms this time is the highest since our church started, including 7 children and youths and 3 adults. These children and youths have been involved in church activities from a young age. Through worshiping with adults, Sunday school, Friday fellowship, and other activities, they have been moved and enlightened by the Holy Spirit, recognizing themselves as sinners and willing to accept Jesus Christ as their personal Savior. Their baptism is inseparable from the diligent cultivation of all their Sunday school teachers. Their tears shed yesterday in sowing have brought forth today’s joyful harvest.

During the pre-baptism class, when I asked them one by one, “Why do you want to be baptized?”

They all answered, “I want to follow Jesus.”

I asked them, “Is someone else asking you to be baptized?”

They said, “No. It’s my own decision.”

When Horace (he had some developmental delay) expressed his desire to be baptized, his mother was a little worried, fearing that he might not be mature enough mentally and would back out at the last minute. He used to run away when he was sick and saw a doctor, especially when the doctor took out a needle. I reassured his mother, saying, “Don’t worry, a person’s desire to follow the Lord is moved by the Holy Spirit, and the Lord will take care of him.” During the baptism, Horace did great! He wasn’t nervous at all, and he didn’t run away. When I asked them in the baptistry if they were willing to express their lifelong commitment to follow the Lord through baptism, everyone else answered with the standard response, “I am willing.” Ellie, the little girl, was adorable. She replied loudly, “Change!” Her answer was excellent. Indeed, Christians need to renew their minds and change every day, becoming more and more like Christ. These children are blessed because they have eternal life and hope from a young age.

The three adults have all experienced God in their lives. Sister Zhang testified, “Before, I only came to church for fun. But this time, the Lord opened my heart. I deeply experienced the presence of the Holy Spirit last year before my surgery. There is truly peace, joy, and strength in the Lord.” Sister Xie said, “Before coming to the United States, I experienced great trials and difficulties in my heart, almost losing direction in life and the courage to live. Since coming to church, I have felt an extraordinary calmness and comfort in my heart. I am willing to follow Jesus for the rest of my life.” Sister Shen exclaimed, “It’s wonderful to believe in the Lord. It has an impact on our work, life, studies, emotional stability, and even work efficiency.” Brother Zhang, who was taking photos, said to Sister Shen, “When I saw the tears in the corner of your eyes just before you were baptized, I cried too. I felt your love for God. I pray that the Lord will keep you deeply in love with Him and living for Him.” Sister Shen responded, “Thank the Lord for giving me the precious opportunity to receive this blessing from above! Thank you for capturing this beautiful moment for me!” May the Lord keep these ten brothers and sisters living out a more abundant life in the future!

Secondly, the testimony of Wu Hong and Han Tao.

During the gathering, Sister Wu Hong recounted the wonderful grace of the Lord. Wu Hong and Han Tao are a deeply loving couple. Their studies and lives were smooth sailing, excelling in their careers and having a beautiful family. However, unforeseen events occurred. On January 20th of this year, Han Tao, who had always been strong and healthy, suddenly felt unwell and was rushed to the emergency room. He underwent heart stent surgery. After the surgery, he was greatly affected emotionally and was hospitalized again. It was during this process that they came to know and experience the Lord. At the end of their testimony, they sang “10,000 Reasons,” bringing tears to the eyes of some brothers and sisters. Here are my reflections on their testimony:

Firstly, they truly experienced God during this process. Wu Hong said, “Everything is God’s best plan.” During this time, when she was at her strongest physically, she had the strength to take care of Tao; their college-aged son stayed at home, bringing her comfort; when he was ill, many friends were there to help; her boss gave her time off, and her colleagues took over her work, allowing her to take care of Tao, and so on.

Secondly, the Lord not only saved Han Tao but also saved Wu Hong. Previously, their pattern in their marital relationship was that the husband took care of everything for the wife, and the wife relied on the husband for everything. Now, Wu Hong said, “I told my husband that from now on, we will both rely on the Lord and help each other.” The mighty power of God saved Tao from the bondage of illness, granting him true freedom. When Tao fell ill, Wu Hong was almost in a state of collapse, but through the experience of caring for her husband, she became stronger and more mature. Most importantly, her soul found peace, and she was filled with joy and strength in all things.

Thirdly, the power of prayer. The Lord said, “The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective” (James 5:16b). During this period, many brothers and sisters prayed for them, including prayer groups on WeChat, church morning prayers, Wednesday evening prayers, and more. Each visit from pastors and coworkers showed significant improvement. It was miraculous that on February 7th, the day Tao was transferred to the emergency room at Baptist Health Hospital, as soon as I entered the room, he opened his eyes. I asked him if he wanted to believe in the Lord. He said loudly, “I believe in the Lord, and from now on, I will follow Jesus on the path of eternal life.” That day, he made a decision to follow Jesus. Hong mentioned that on the evening of March 7th, she felt a warmth lasting for 1-2 seconds. The next day, she saw a scripture posted in the WeChat prayer group about God’s hands surrounding her. On March 8th, Tao was discharged from the hospital. Every time the doctors visited him, they were amazed and moved by his rapid recovery.

Fourthly, teamwork is essential in service. Throughout the process, many church brothers and sisters, colleagues from their workplace, and friends took turns delivering meals, accompanying them in the hospital, and visiting them. It truly showed the power of love from everyone! May the Lord remember the selfless care and love of each one.

Sister Liu shared, “I have many friends like Hong and Tao around me. They are all good people, but they have not believed in the Lord yet. Perhaps when people themselves are too perfect, it’s difficult for them to feel the need for the Lord. This time, I truly saw God’s work in Tao and Hong. It’s a miracle that they could come to know the Lord and walk into His embrace in such a short time! I pray that more of my friends will be moved to believe in the Lord soon!”

As the hymn sings, “The most beautiful blessing in life is to know the Lord Jesus, the most beautiful blessing in life is to trust in the Lord Jesus.” Thank God for giving us this testimony. May our church have more people testify for the Lord in the future, glorifying His holy name! Amen!

### 诗篇118：24 这是耶和华所定的日子，我们在其中要高兴欢喜。

2024年3月24日是一个值得我们教会纪念的日子，因为这日有十位弟兄姐妹作了浸礼的见证，吴红和韩涛也作了他们信主得救与得医治的见证。这是上帝所定的日子，这是众弟兄姐妹高兴欢喜的日子。

第一，浸礼的见证

浸礼是信徒为主作的最美的见证，它标志着基督徒灵程的起点、而不是终点。浸信会相信基督徒奉圣父，圣子，圣灵的名受浸礼是顺服的行动，象征信徒的信仰与主同钉死，同埋葬，和同复活。浸入水中指信徒向罪而死，将旧人埋葬，复活是在基督里的新生命与主同行。浸礼是见证末期死人复活的信仰。

这次浸礼人数是自教会成立以来最多的一次，包括七位青少年与儿童和三位成人。这些小朋友和青少年基本上从小就参加教会活动。在这个过程中，他们通过与成人一起敬拜、主日学、周五团契等，受圣灵感动和光照，认识自己是罪人并愿意接受耶稣基督为他们个人的救主。他们能受浸礼离不开所有教导过他们的主日学老师的辛勤耕耘，他们昨日的流泪撒种、换来今日的欢呼收割。

### 在浸礼前的课上，当我一个一个地问他们：”你为什么要受浸礼”？

### 他们都回答说：”我要跟随耶稣”。

### 我问他们：”是别人要你受浸礼的吗”？

### 他们说：”不是。是我自己要的。”

当Horace表达想要受浸礼时，他妈妈有点儿担心，怕他心智不够成熟，会临阵脱逃。他从前生病看医生，当医生拿出针时他会逃跑。我劝他妈妈说：”不用担心，一个人要跟随主是圣灵的感动，主会对他负责的”。在受浸礼时，Horace表现得非常棒！他没有紧张，更没有逃跑。在浸礼池里牧师问他们是否愿意借着浸礼表达自己一生要跟随主时，其他人都按着标准答案回答说：”我愿意”。Ellie小朋友非常可爱，她大声回答说：”改变”！她的答案太好了，基督徒的确需要每天心意更新而变化，并且要越来越像基督。这些孩子是蒙福的，因为从小就有永生、有盼望。

三位成人都在生命中经历到上帝。张姐妹见证说：”我之前来教会是凑热闹。这次主打开了我的心。当我去年在作手术之前，我深刻经历到圣灵的同在。在主里面真有平安、喜乐和力量。” 谢姐妹说：”我没来美国之前，心灵里曾经历过很大的考验和艰难，几乎失去人生的方向和活着的勇气。我自从来到教会，心灵里感受到异常的平静和安慰。我愿意一生跟随耶稣”。申姐妹赞叹说：”信主真好。这对我们工作、生活、学习以及心理状态都有影响。”摄影的张弟兄对申姐妹说：”拍照的时候看到您受洗前那一刹那眼角有泪的时候，我也落泪了。感受到了您对神的爱，求主保守您深深爱主，为主而活”。申姐妹回应说：”感谢赞美主让我有机会领受这从上而来的福份！谢谢您为我拍下这美好瞬间！”求主保守这十位弟兄姐妹在今后能活出更丰盛的生命！

第二，    吴红和韩涛的见证

在聚会中，吴红姐妹讲述了主的奇妙恩典。吴红和韩涛是一对十分恩爱的夫妻。他们的学业和生活顺风顺水，既在工作上优秀、又拥有美好的家庭。然而，天有不测风云。今年1月20日，身体一向强壮的韩涛突感不适而送到医院急诊室。他做了心脏支架手术。术后，他的情绪上受到很大影响，再次住进医院。在这个过程中，他们认识和经历到了主。在见证结束时，他们夫妻唱了”上万个理由（10,000 Reasons）”，有些弟兄姐妹感动得热泪盈眶。对他们的见证我有以下几点感受：

第一，在这个过程中，他们真实地经历到了上帝。吴红说：”一切都是上帝最好的安排”。这段时间是她身体最强壮的时候，她可以有力量照顾韩涛；上大学的儿子在家里住，给她带来安慰；他生病时有许多朋友在身边鼎力相助；她老板给她放假、同事胜任她的工作，使她可以照顾韩涛等。

第二，主不仅拯救了韩涛，也拯救了吴红。之前他们夫妻关系的模式是丈夫凡事照顾妻子、妻子凡事依靠丈夫。如今，吴红说：”我和丈夫说，我们从今以后都依靠主，互相帮助”。上帝的大能拯救韩涛脱离疾病的捆绑，使他获得真正的自由。韩涛开始生病时，吴红整个人几乎处于崩溃状态，然而经过照顾丈夫的历练，她变得更加成熟坚强。最重要的是，她的心灵平和下来，凡事充满喜乐和力量。

第三，祈祷有力量。主说：”义人祈祷所发的力量是大有功效的”（雅5：16下）。在此期间，许多弟兄姐妹为他们代祷，包括微信祷告小组、教会晨祷会、周三晚祷等。牧者们和同工们每次探访都有明显的好转。很神奇的是，2月7日韩涛刚转到Baptist Health医院急诊那天，我一进病房他马上睁开眼睛。我问他是否要信主？他大声说：”我信主，我从今往后要跟随耶稣，走永生的道路”。那天，他做了决志祷告。吴红提到，3月7日晚上，她觉得有一股热量，持续了1-2秒钟。第二天，她看到微信代祷群里发的经文正讲到上帝的手四围环绕。3月8日韩涛就出院了。医生每次看到他，都为他迅速的恢复感动惊讶不已。

第四，团队服侍。在整个过程中，有许多教会弟兄姐妹、他们单位的同事和朋友们轮流送饭，在医院陪伴、探访等。真看出众人爱心的力量！愿主记念他们每一位的无私关怀和爱心。

刘姐妹分享说：”我周围像吴红和韩涛这样的朋友很多，他们为人都很好，但还没有信主。也许当人自我太完美时，很难感受到需要主。这次在韩涛和吴红身上真看到上帝的作为。他们在这么短的时间内能认识主，并能走到主的里面，这真是神迹！求主感动我更多的朋友能早日信主！”

就如诗歌所唱的：”这一生最美的祝福就是能认识主耶稣，这一生最美的祝福就是能信靠主耶稣。” 感谢上帝赐予我们见证。愿我们教会今后能有更多人为主作见证，荣耀主的圣名！阿门！

周一到周五早5：00，周六早6：00。每次一个小时。周日没有。由弟兄姐妹轮流带领，欢迎弟兄姐妹参加。Zoom ID:501.501.7777,密码:777。
