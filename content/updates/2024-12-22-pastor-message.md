**12/22/24 Pastor’s Word12/22/24 Pastor’s Word**
“Out of the mouths of babes…”

I had the opportunity to help raise my grandchild for the first four years of her life.  It was a privilege &amp; joy to have Tayler Morgan &amp; her mom, Aimee in my home.  We had some wonderful times &amp; Tayler Morgan was the smartest,  funniest, most beautiful little girl I have ever known (is that a typical Grammy, or what!)

I need to tell you that I am a person that never curses…..now wait a minute, no offense to anyone that does.  I was raised by a Mom that never said any slang or curse words.  She would say, “Ladies do not say those kinds of words… especially little ladies.”  So, I didn’t.  This is where it gets interesting &amp; a little bit funny.  After I left home, &amp; got married, I picked up a word that I know my Mom didn’t approve of, but it became my “go to slang word.”  Here it is… “Crap!”  Not very lady like but, I said it anyway, when the “word” fit the situation.  Tay’s mom, Aimee asked me to stop using that word around Tay, she was picking it up &amp; the next time she says it, Aimee said, “I will spank her” (those were the days that you could actually spank your child without anyone accusing you of being a bad parent).  I told her I would not say that word again.  I did not want Tay to get a spanking because of me &amp; my unwise choice of the word, “Crap.”

Do you remember back when we went to the bank, years ago, for me it would have been 28 years ago; they used to give you those multi-colored fruit  flavored suckers with the looped soft, twisted strings on them.  The lady at the bank knew I had a 2-year-old granddaughter, &amp; she used to give me 2 suckers every time I went through the drive thru.  I always gave them to Tayler Morgan when I went home, &amp; she loved banking days!

On my next banking day, sure enough the lady gave me 2 suckers for Tayler Morgan.  When I got home, I gave them to Tay &amp; then I left the room to make some dinner.  Aimee was in the back of the house.  I came back into the living room &amp; there were the sucker strings &amp; wrappers torn up &amp; tossed on the living room floor.  I said, “Tayler Morgan, what is that!?”  She looked at me with her sweet little face &amp; said, “Looks like Crap to me, Grammy.”  Then I heard Aimee’s voice from down the hallway saying, “What did she say?!”  I said, “Oh, nothing, she didn’t say anything,” as I was scrambling to pick up the mess in the floor &amp; hide it quickly in the trash.

The moral of this story is, don’t say any words that you would not want to hear coming out of the mouths of your precious little “babes.”

We will be praying for each of you this Christmas.  Have a very Merry Christmas…..and watch what you say around your little ones, or you could end up on Santa’s naughty list!

12/22/24 牧者之言

“从婴孩儿的口中……”

我有机会在孙女生命的前四年里帮助她成长。泰勒·摩根和她妈妈艾米住在我家，这是一种荣幸和快乐。我们度过了一段美好的时光，泰勒·摩根是最聪明、最有趣，我所认识的最美丽的小女孩（那是典型的格莱美奖得主，还是什么！）

我需要告诉你，我是一个从不骂人的人……等一下，我无意冒犯那些骂人的人。我的母亲从小就从不说俚语或脏话。她会说，“女士们不会说那种话……尤其是小女士们。”所以，我不骂人。这就是事情变得有趣和有点搞笑的地方。在我离开家结婚后，我学会了一个我知道我妈妈不赞成的词，但它却成了我的“常用俚语”。就是这个……“废话！”不太像女士的说话方式，但当“这个词”适合某种情况时，我还是会说。泰勒的妈妈艾米让我不要在泰勒旁边说那个词，她学会了，下次她说那个词时，艾米说：“我会打她屁股”（那时，你可以打你的孩子屁股，而不会有人指责你是坏父母）。我告诉她我不会再说那个词了。我不想让泰勒因为我和我不明智地选择“废话”这个词而挨打。

还记得几年前我们去银行的时候吗？对我来说，那是 28 年前的事了；他们过去常常给你那些五颜六色的水果味棒棒糖，上面有柔软的扭绳。银行的那位女士知道我有个 2 岁的孙女，每次我开车经过时，她都会给我 2 个棒棒糖。我回家时总是把它们送给泰勒·，她很喜欢我去银行的日子！

在我下一个银行日，那位女士果然给了我 2 个送给泰勒的棒棒糖。我回到家后，把它们给了泰勒，然后离开房间去做晚饭。艾米在房子后面。我回到客厅，发现糖果棒的绳子和包装纸被撕碎，扔在客厅的地板上。我说：“泰勒·，那是什么！？”她用她可爱的小脸看着我，说： “奶奶，在我看来，这简直是垃圾。” 然后我听到走廊那头艾米的声音说： “她说了什么？！”我说：“哦，没什么，她什么都没说。”同时我手忙脚乱地捡起地板上的杂物，并迅速把它藏在垃圾桶里。

这个故事的寓意是，不要说任何你不想从你宝贵的小“宝贝”嘴里听到的话。

今年圣诞节我们会为你们每个人祈祷。祝你们圣诞快乐……注意你在孩子面前说的话，否则你可能会被列入圣诞老人的淘气名单！
