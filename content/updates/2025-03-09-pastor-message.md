**3/9/25 Pastor’s Word**
Deborah

### Scripture Reading: Judges 4: 1-24

### Reference: Judges 5: 1-31

Q: Brothers and sisters, how many sisters have influenced your life in your faith journey?

---
**A: Most of leaders in the Southern Baptist Convention are men; however, it is amazing that one of the most influential people among us is Lottie Moon, who was a missionary in Shandong, China. Every Christmas, there is a donation project in her name for world missions. In the process of my belief, many sisters have deeply influenced my life. Among the sisters who have fallen asleep, at least three are worth mentioning: First, Zhao Guiqin: She was the one who preached the gospel to me and influenced me to establish morning prayer meetings. Second, Pastor Xu Enci: She was a senior pastor in Nanjing. When I went to Nanjing Theological Seminary in 1998, she taught me the “Bible Introduction Course” and led the students to study from Genesis to Revelation. She taught me to be familiar with the Bible and laid a biblical foundation. Third, Professor Faye Pearson: She was the Director of the International Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Church in Asia and served in Taiwan and mainland China for 42 years. She gave up her love and devoted her life to sharing the gospel in Asia. She influenced my character and how to be a leader. In many people’s lives, God has prepared some sisters who love and fear the Lord to become a blessing in our lives.**
The judge we are preaching today is the first female judge, Deborah. The Hebrew word means “bee,” which reminds us of humility just as bees are humble insects; at the same time, it can also refer to the queen in each hive, leading the territory. Deborah led the people of her time like a queen bee. Her husband’s name is also very interesting. His name is Lapidoth, which means “torch” or “light,” and the word “torch” in Hebrew is feminine plural (Judges 15:4 torches), meaning “sister of light” or “sister of flame.” It seems to refer to his wife Deborah as a “sister of fire.” This name seems to reflect that his wife was a person who was greatly used by God.

Judges 4:1 The death of Ehud marked the end of another era. In that era, God brought victory and rest through Judge Ehud, a man with a left hand. At that time, the country was at rest for 80 years. However, like us today, the Israelites forgot the pain so fast. Human sin is very stubborn, like a malignant tumor that can recur at any time. When Ehud died, the Israelites returned to their old way, turned away from God, and did what was evil in God’s eyes.

Let’s look at several roles in this passage. The first one is Jehovah. This chapter repeatedly mentions Jehovah (4: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 14, 15, in total 7 times; plus “God”1 time, 4:23), which shows us God’s sovereignty. God is a holy and righteous God. He acts in history. His will toward us is all good, to give us peace, not to bring disaster. Our God is merciful, gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in lovingkindness. He does not remain angry for long, nor does he rebuke forever. When God’s people sin, God disciplines them. When God’s people pray to God and turn back, God extends his hand of salvation and raises up the people he uses to rescue them, so that they can win over their enemies. Facing this just and righteous God, we should never say, “God, please stand on my side.” Instead, we should pray like President Lincoln: “God, please let us stand on your side.” We should never focus our eyes on a certain king/leader, but on the Lord of Hosts.

When God’s people sinned, He demanded whatever it took, even handing them over to their enemies. This time, the Lord once again gave them over (sold them to) their enemies. The original word for “give” is “sold,” indicating that God took the initiative to hand over His people to their enemies. Psalm 44:12 “You sold your people for a pittance, gaining nothing from their sale.” What did God gain by selling His people to foreigners? Humiliation! God sacrificed His glory and handed His children over to foreigners. It seemed very cruel, but in fact, God only has one purpose - to make them change their hearts and return to the Lord again.

### The Second Role: Enemies (4:2-3)

Jabin, the Canaanite king who reigned in Hazor, and his commander Barbara. “Jabin” is a title, like the “emperor” of China or the “pharaoh” of Egypt. Note that when Joshua led the people to conquer the land of Canaan, he led the people to completely conquer Hazor and set everything there on fire (Joshua 11:10-13). However, in the Book of Judges, the Ephraimites were not thorough in their battles, and they did not drive out the Canaanites in Ephraim (Judges 1:29). What was the result? After more than 100 years, the Canaanites rose again and ran to Hazor, which had been completely conquered. They came back with great strength and oppressed the Israelites greatly until the 20th year (4:3). What terrible consequence the stubbornness of human sinful nature brings! Perhaps when we first believed in the Lord, by entrusting ourselves to the Lord, our pride, arrogance, and self-righteousness were slowly changed, and we became more and more humble. Before long, because we were not alert, we gradually became greedy for the world, so that we returned to our former pride, arrogance, and self-righteousness, and all our bad habits returned. Many times, these sinful habits lead to the attack of enemies. Before Othniel, the people thought of calling on God after suffering for 8 years; before Ehud, the people thought of calling on God after suffering for 18 years; and before Deborah, the people thought of calling on God after suffering for 20 years. We can see how rebellious, stubborn and hardened people’s hearts are.

One characteristic of this enemy, King Jabin of Canaan, is that he has a commander named Sisera. Sisera lived in the Gentile country of Harosheth. Just like Satan has a servant on earth. This commander executed his master’s evil schemes and continued to expand their territory. This enemy was very powerful. They had 900 iron chariots. Iron chariots were equivalent to the most advanced weapons at that time. AI tells us that modern weapons are developing in the direction of “intelligent, unmanned, high-speed, and precise.” Future wars might rely more on artificial intelligence, cyber warfare, and direct energy weapons. The iron chariots of the Judges era were insurmountable for people at that time. In 1:19, it is said that the tribe of Judah can attack the inhabitants of the mountains, “but they cannot drive out the inhabitants of the plains because they have iron chariots.” King Jabin of Canaan already had 900 iron chariots. It can be imagined that their advanced level was invincible in the eyes of people.

The Third, the people raised up by God

1. Deborah

The Israelites had been oppressed by their enemies for 20 years, and the people’s lives were miserable, with no freedom and no peace. 5:6 “In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, and in the days of Jael, the roads were abandoned; travelers took to winding paths.” The Israelites were deprived of their freedom by their enemies; the highways were taken away, and they could only live in misery and find narrow paths to travel. Everyone in the people had weak faith, and among the many brothers, there was no one who was in line with God’s will. Therefore, God raised up a sister with faith. Through her, God wanted to awaken that era and lead the people out of the spiritual darkness and into the light. This sister Deborah rose up in the mountains of Ephraim; this place was where the Canaanites made a comeback (1:29). God’s will is that where the enemy rises up, God’s servants will also rise up; where we fall, there we will arise; where we are weak, there we will become strong. At any era, it was not easy for people to accept the leadership of a sister. Compared with male leaders, she must have extraordinary faith and service to be recognized by everyone. She may have to bear more pressure and burden than brothers.

Deborah was a prophetess who understood God’s will and conveyed messages on behalf of God. She was also a judge: the two duties of a judge were to judge cases for the people during peacetime and to lead the people to fight against the enemy during war. What was the specific mission God giving her? God wanted her to call one brother to stand up and serve the Lord! She followed God’s will.

2. Barak

In 4:6, Deborah sent people from Kedesh in Naphtali to call Barak to lead the people to fight against the enemy. Kedesh was located a little further north of Hazor, where the enemy was. From beginning to end, Deborah was not exalting her own authority or establishing her own influence. Deborah did not have the ambition to be an emperor like Wu Zetian, nor did she have the power of Empress Dowager Cixi to rule behind the scenes in China history. Everything she did was only to fulfill the mission given to her by God and to restore the correct relationship between the Israelites and God. Why didn’t God’s word come directly to Barak? It shows that Barak did not have the faith to receive God’s mission directly. He had to receive God’s mission through the prophetess, the judge, Deborah who had more faith. In a sense, Deborah was Barak’s spiritual mentor, training him to stand up and serve the Lord.

---
**I remember that Pastor Xu Enci (1930-2018), who preached in Nanjing at the end of last century, often stated that we must respect the order established by God in the church. The church should let brothers lead. If brothers do not stand up to serve, sisters should stand up bravely. She said, “If it is a Lord’s Supper, I would rather let brother(s) lead as long as it is possible.” The key thing we should emphasize is not whether brothers or sisters serve, but whoever God raises up should serve. Here we see that God’s work was to raise up Deborah first and then used her to build up brother Barak’s faith.**
How did Barak react to God’s call and command? Did he have faith? 4:8 Barak said, “If you go with me, I will go; but if you don’t go with me, I won’t go.” He needed his spiritual sister Deborah, and he relied on her spirituality more than on the almighty God. From this, he seemed a little disappointed. There is an old Chinese saying: “A rotten mud cannot be supported on a wall.” The good thing is that he was at least willing to go, but his going was conditional. If you accompany me to fight the enemy, I will go; if you don’t accompany me, I won’t go. I can’t do it myself; I need guidance and encouragement. Deborah did not belittle or despise this disciple who lacked faith but continued to encourage him. She said that I can go with you, but in the end, you will not get the glory, because God will use the hands of another sister to eliminate the enemy. Then Barak led the warriors to Mount Tabor. At this time, God spoke through Deborah again, commanding Barak to act and come down from Mount Tabor (4:14): At the critical moment, they had to come down from Mount Tabor to the Kishon River to meet the enemy. This was a breakthrough of faith. At that time, they might have thought that it was safer on Mount Tabor, but it would be more difficult to go to the plains because the iron chariots could work much better on the plains. However, God is in control of everything. Just as they were coming down the mountain, God might cause heavy rain to fall from the sky (5:4), making it impossible for Sisera’s iron chariot to move forward. In this way, Barak and his army completely defeated the enemy and won a great victory.

3. Jael

First, Jael was the wife of Zeber the Kenite, a Gentile who lived with the Israelites. Numbers 10:29-32 says that Hobab, Moses’ brother-in-law, was the ancestor of the Kenites. When the Israelites were in the wilderness, Moses invited Hobab to stay as an eye to help the Israelites see the location of camp and promised that they would share the benefits of the Lord with the Israelites. He stayed and became the ancestor of the Kenites. Judges 4:11 specifically inserted this sentence to pave the way for the introduction of Jael, indicating that God had long prepared the person who would defeat the enemy. Judges 4:17 talks about Jabin, king of Hazor, making peace with the house of Heber the Kenite, which may emphasize the political strategy of the king of Hazor: he may have thought that the Kenites were not Israelites, and in order to have a good relationship with them, he took the initiative to seek peace with them.

Second, she was an ordinary housewife. Among so many people, God could not find a man with a strong faith to serve, so He raised up this sister to accomplish a great thing for the Lord. When this commander fled from failure, what did she do to the enemy? She was calm, composed, and never panicked. She was warm and welcoming: Sisera asked for water, and she gave him milk to drink, and she also gave him butter on a precious plate (5:25). She took a hammer in her left hand and a peg in her right hand and killed the enemy. It is said that the work of dismantling and setting up the tent was undertaken by sisters at that time. Hammer and peg were tools for pitching tents. This sister eliminated the enemy in the way of her daily work.

As a sister, Jael risked her life to get rid of the enemy. This shows us courage in battle. For Christians today, we face spiritual battles every day (Ephesians 6: 10-17). Today the church is in battle! Our church should be a fighting church. We should exalt Jesus, condemn sin, repent thoroughly, and lead people to the Lord with courageous faith. For example, has anyone among us ever experienced a nightmare? A nightmare is a state of being half asleep and half awake, with a clear mind but unable to move, accompanied by fear, and even a dark shadow pressing on you, making you feel like you can’t breathe. This phenomenon cannot be explained completely by science. We Christians know that it is a spiritual battle. Can you be friendly to that enemy? No. You must remember to fight the enemy bravely like Jael. You must rebuke the devil in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, fighting with it, and it will retreat.

To summarize: Judges 4 emphasizes two sisters, one is Deborah - faith, and the other is Jael - courage. The Lord does not want to exalt men or women, but to let us know His power. Barak did not seem to have much faith at the beginning, but as he obeyed God’s will, his faith must have been built up as he moved forward step by step. God allowed him to see with his own eyes that from the advantageous Mount Tabor to the disadvantaged plains, God could still make them victorious. God also allowed him to witness with his own eyes how his enemy eventually died at the hands of a sister (4:22). After the war, he and Deborah wrote a song to praise God (5:1). When listing the witnesses of faith in Hebrews 11, the Holy Spirit specifically listed Barak among them (11:32). We may ask, is God fair? Why isn’t Debora on the list? In fact, Deborah and Barak were both doing God’s work. In history, some people were mentioned and many were not. These people were all remembered by God. And Deborah’s mission was to cultivate and build Barak’s faith. Wasn’t it the greatest comfort and recognition for her when she saw Bara become a leader in faith?

Challenge: God can use you! You need to rise!

God can raise up all people to serve Him, and God wants to use you. God can use Ehud, who was left-handed, Deborah, a wife, Jael, the Kenite, and David, a young man, who defeated giant Goliath. What God is really looking for is people who are willing to obey Him, believe in His power, and dedicate themselves to Him. God wants to use you! A sister who participated in the prayer meeting was a custodian. She prayed, “Lord, you not only let me clean the outside, but also let me clean the hearts of people; I will watch and pray for the souls of the people in the whole building and pray for their salvation.” This sister is the high priest of the kingdom of heaven, and her service is what God is pleased with!

For a while, our morning prayer meeting specifically prayed for more brothers to rise! Thank you to all the sisters in the church for your service. Without your service, the church cannot function well. But we must pray that the Lord will raise more brothers who are willing to serve the Lord voluntarily. There is a wrong concept that prayer is a sister’s business and service is a sister’s business. We forget that the most direct reason for Eve’s sin was Adam’s failure to take care of the Garden of Eden, leaving the devil with a room to enter. If brothers are not raised as leaders, how can families be victorious? How can the church be revived? May the Lord raise up more brothers, take responsibility, lead family worship, serve the church’s ministry, and influence this era for Christ.

Finally, let us pray: Dear Lord, please raise us up, just as you raised Deborah, Barak, and Jael in ancient times! “So may all your enemies perish, O Lord! But may those who love you be like the sun when it rises in its strength” (Judges 5: 31)! Amen.

底波拉

### 读经: 士4: 1-24

### 参: 士 5: 1-31

### 问：弟兄姐妹，在你信主的过程中，有多少姐妹影响了你的生命？

答：我们美南浸信会多半是以弟兄作领袖；然而，奇妙的是，其中影响力最大的人之一却是曾到中国山东去宣教的慕拉第（Lottie Moon），每年圣诞节都有以她的名义作为向海外宣教的奉献项目。在我信主的过程中，有许多姐妹曾深深影响过我的生命。在睡去的姐妹中，至少有三位是值得一提的：第一是赵桂芹（二姐）：她是传福音给我的人，她影响我建立晨祷会。第二，徐恩赐牧师：她是南京的一位老牧师，98年我去金陵读书时，她教我《圣经引读课》，带领学生们通读从《创世记》一直到《启示录》。她教导我熟悉圣经，奠定圣经基础。第三，裴斐老师(Faye Pearson): 她曾任美南浸信会驻亚洲区的总干事，在台湾和中国大陆宣教42年。她为到亚洲传福音放弃了自己的爱情，完全献上自己的一生。她影响了我的品格和如何作领袖。神在许多人的生命中预备了一些爱主敬畏主的姐妹，成为他们生命中的祝福。

今天我们讲的士师是第一位女士师底波拉——希伯来文意思是“蜜蜂”🐝，它提醒像蜜蜂一样卑微勤劳；同时，它也可以指蜂房中的王后带领领地。底波拉像蜂后一样，带领了她那个时代的人。她丈夫的名字很有意思。他叫拉比多，意思是“火炬” 或 “发光”，希伯来文中这个词“火炬”是阴性复数（士15：4火把），意为“光明的姐妹”或“火焰的姐妹”。这名字似乎暗示他的妻子是“火热的姐妹”。这名字似乎反应出他的妻子是为神所大用的人。

士4：1以笏死后，标志着又一个时代的结束。那个时代，神借着士师以笏——左手便利的人带来得胜与太平。那时，国中太平了80年。然而，像今天的我们一样，以色列人总了伤疤忘了疼。人的罪性非常顽固，就像一个恶性毒瘤，随时都有可能复发。当以笏去世后，以色列人重操旧业，远离神，行神眼中看为恶的事。

让我们看一下士师记第4章的几个角色。第一个就是耶和华。 这章经文反复提到耶和华（1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 14, 15, 7次耶和华；23，1次“神”），让我们看到神的主权。神是圣洁公义的神，他掌管历史，也掌管他子民的命运。神向我们所怀的意念都是好的，为了要赐平安，不是降灾祸。我们的神是有怜悯、有恩惠、不轻易发怒，且有丰盛慈爱的神，他不长久坏怒，也不永远责备。当神子民犯罪，神便管教。当神子民向神祈祷回转时，神便伸出拯救的手，兴起他所使用的人来搭救他们，使他们得胜，使仇敌失败。面对这位公正公义的神，我们永远不要说“神啊，求你站在我这边”；而要像林肯总统所祷告的那样：“神啊，求你让我们站在你那边。”神是历史的掌管者。我们的眼光永远不要定睛在某个君王身上，而要定睛在万军之耶和华那里。

当神的子民犯罪时，神不惜一切代价，甚至将他们交给敌人。这次，耶和华再一次将他们付于敌人。“付于”原文是“卖给”，表明是神主动把自己的百姓交给仇敌作奴隶。神付出了管教的代价。诗篇44：12你卖了你的子民也不赚利，所得的价值并不加添你的资财。神将他的子民卖给外邦人，神自己得到了什么？羞辱！神不惜牺牲自己的荣耀，把自己的儿女交在外邦人手里，这看似非常残忍、实则只有一个目的——使他们回心转意，再次归向耶和华。

### 第二个角色：仇敌（4：2-3）

在夏琐作王的迦南王耶宾和他的大将军巴巴拉。“耶宾”是称号，就像中国的“皇帝”或埃及的“法老”一样。注意，在约书亚带领百姓征服迦南地的时候，他带领百姓完全征服了夏琐，并将那里的一切都放火焚烧了（书11：10-13）。然而，在士师记时，以法莲人在争战的时候不彻底，他们没有赶出在基色的迦南人（士1：29）。结果怎样？这里的迦南人经过100多年之后再次崛起，跑到曾彻底被征服的夏琐卷土重来，实力强大，便大大欺压以色列人，直到20年（4：3）。人罪性的顽固带来的后果何等可怕！也许我们在刚信主时通过将自己交托给主，我们的骄傲、自大、自以为义慢慢被改变，变得越来越谦卑。没过多久，由于我们不警醒祷告，逐渐贪恋世界，以至于我们又回到从前的骄傲、自大、自以为义，所有坏习惯又都回来了。很多时候，这些罪恶坏习惯导致的恶果就是仇敌的攻击。俄陀聂之前百姓受苦8年后想到呼求上帝；以笏之前百姓受苦18年后想到呼求上帝；底波拉之前百姓受苦20年后才想到呼求上帝。我们看到人心多么悖逆顽固和刚硬。

这次的敌人迦南王耶宾的一个特点是，他有一个大将军叫西西拉。西西拉住在外邦的夏罗设。与之相似，撒旦在地上也有差役，这个差役替它执行它邪恶计谋，并不断扩张它的领地。这次的敌人非常强大，他们拥有900辆铁车。铁车是当时的先进武器。AI 告诉我们，现代武器正在向 “智能化、无人化、高速化、精准化” 方向发展，未来战争可能更多依赖人工智能、网络战和定向能武器。士师时代的铁车，对于当时的人来说是无法逾越的。在1：19 讲到犹大支派能攻打山上的居民，“只是不能赶出平原的居民，因为他们有铁车”。这时的迦南王耶宾已经拥有900辆铁车，可以想象他们先进的程度在人看来已经不可战胜。

第三，神所兴起的人

1. 底波拉

首先，以色列人受仇敌欺压20年，百姓的生活叫苦连天，没有自由，没有平安。5：6 “在亚拿之子珊迦的时候，又在雅亿的日子，大道无人行走，都是绕道而行”。 以色列人被敌人剥夺了自由；大道被占有，他们只能苟且偷生，找小路行走。

那时百姓中每个人都信心软弱，众多弟兄中找不到一个合乎神心意的人。故此，神要兴起一位有信心的姐妹，神要借着她唤醒那个时代，带领百姓走出灵性的黑暗，进入神所赐的光明。这个姐妹在以法莲山地兴起；这地正是迦南人卷土重来的地方（1：29）。神的心意是，敌人在哪里兴起、神的仆人也在哪里兴起；我们在那里跌倒就在哪里爬起来，在哪里软弱就在哪里刚强。一位姐妹的兴起是一件不容易的事。在那个时代或任何时代都是这样，众人不太容易接受姐妹的带领。与男性领袖比较起来，姐妹必须有超乎众人、非同寻常的信心和服侍，才能被大家所认可。她可能要承受比弟兄更多的压力和负担。

底波拉是女先知，她明白神的心意，代替神传达信息。她又是女士师。士师的两项职责，一为在和平时替百姓断案；二为战争时带领百姓去与仇敌争战。神给她具体的使命是什么？神要她去呼召弟兄，让弟兄站起来服侍主！她遵行神的旨意去呼召弟兄服侍。

2. 巴拉

在4：6 底波拉打发人从那弗他利的基低斯那里呼召巴拉带领百姓与仇敌争战。基底斯位于敌人所在地夏琐更北一点。从头到尾，底波拉都不是在高举自己的权威或建立自己的影响力。底波拉没有武则天那么爱慕作皇帝的野心，也没有慈禧太后垂帘听政的专权，她所作的一切只为完成神所给她的托付和使命，恢复以色列人与神之间正确的关系。

神的话为何不直接临到巴拉？说明巴拉没有信心可以直接领受神的使命。他必须要借着更有信心的女先知（士师）领受神的使命。从某种意义上说，底波拉是拉巴的属灵导师，培养他站立起来为主服侍。我记得上个世纪末在南京给我们讲道的徐恩赐牧师（1930-2018）常说，我们要尊重上帝在教会中设立的次序。教会应该让弟兄来带领。如果弟兄不起来服侍，姐妹理应勇敢地站起来。她说：“如果是领主餐聚会，只要有可能的情况下，我愿意让弟兄来带领”。我们关键要强调的不是弟兄还是姐妹服侍，而是神兴起了谁、谁就应该去服侍。这里我们看到上帝的心意是先兴起底波拉，再使用她建立弟兄巴拉的信心。

面对神的呼召和命令，巴拉的反应是怎样的？他有信心吗？4:8 巴拉说：“你若同我去，我就去；你若不同我去，我就不去。” 他需要人的同在，他依靠这位属灵的姐妹底波拉过于依靠全能的神。从这里可以看到，他似乎有点儿不争气。这正应了中国的两句俗语：“烂泥扶不上墙”、“扶不起的阿斗”。 好的地方是他至少还是愿意去的，但他去是有条件的。如果你陪我一起去与仇敌争战，我就去；如果你不陪我，我就不去。我自己不行，我需要带领和鼓励。对于这位信心不足的门徒，底波拉没有贬低或轻视他，而是继续鼓励他。他说：我可以同你一起去，但最后你将得不到荣耀，因为神要借着另一个姐妹的手将仇敌彻底除去。接着，巴拉率领战士们上他泊山，底波拉跟随。这时，神又借着底波拉说话，命令巴拉行动起来，从他泊山下来（4：14）： 关键的时候，他们要从他泊山下来，到基顺河去迎敌。这是一个信心的突破。当时人们可能认为在他泊山比较安全，但到了平原就比较困难，因为铁车在平原上可以发挥极大的作用。然而，神掌管一切。正在他们下山的时候，很可能神使天上降下大雨（5：4），让巴拉的铁车无法前进。这样，巴拉带着大军彻底打败了仇敌，使他们大获全胜。

3. 雅亿

首先，雅亿是一个与以色列人同住的外邦人基尼人西百的妻子。民10：29-32讲到，摩西的内兄何巴是基尼人的祖先。当以色列人在旷野时，摩西曾邀请何巴留下来作眼睛帮助以色列人看安营之地，并应许说他们将要与以色列人同得耶和华的好处。他留了下来，并成为基尼人的祖先。士4：11特别插入这句话为介绍雅亿作铺垫，说明战胜仇敌的人选上帝早有预备。士4：17讲到 “夏琐王耶宾与基尼人希百家和好”，可能在强调夏琐王的政治策略，他也许认为基尼人不是以色列人，他为了与他们搞好关系而主动与他们求和。

第二，她是普通的家庭主妇。在那么多人中，神找不到一个合他心意的弟兄起来服侍，便兴起这位姐妹为主成就大事。面对这位逃命的大将军，她作了什么？她沉着冷静，遇事不慌。她热情接待。西西拉要水，她拿出奶子给他喝，她还用宝贵的盘子给他奶油吃（5：25）。她左手拿锤子，右手拿橛子，将敌人除死。据说，当时拆搭帐篷的工作是由姐妹来担当的。锤子和橛子是支搭帐篷的工具。这位姐妹以平日工作的方法将敌人除掉。

作为姐妹，雅亿冒着生命的危险完成了使命。这让我们看到的是她在争战中的勇敢。对于今天的基督徒来说，我们每天都面临着属灵的争战（弗6：10-17）。今天教会正在争战中！我们教会应当成为争战的教会，我们应当在主里高举耶稣，谴责罪恶，彻底悔改，带着勇敢的信心领人归主。举个例子，我们中间是否有人经历过梦魇？梦魇是指在半梦半醒中意识清醒但身体却无法动弹，并且伴随着恐惧、甚至有黑影压身，使你有一种无法呼吸的感觉。这个现象科学无法完全解释。我们基督徒知道，这就是一种属灵的争战。面对那个仇敌，你要像雅亿一样勇敢。你要凭信心奉拿撒勒人耶稣基督之名斥责仇敌，与仇敌争战，仇敌便会退去。

总结一下：  《士》4章主要强调两位姐妹，一个是底波拉——信心，一个是雅亿——勇敢。  然而，主并不是要高举男人或女人，而是要我们知道他的大能。巴拉开始时似乎没有多大信心，但随着他顺服神的旨意，在一步一步往前走的过程中信心得到了建立。神让他亲眼看到从优势的他泊山下到劣势的平原之地，上帝依然能使他们得胜。神也让他亲眼见证他的仇敌最终死在一位姐妹的手中（4：22）。在战争结束后，他和底波拉一起做诗歌称颂神的作为（5：1）。在《来》11章列信心见证人时，圣灵特别将巴拉列在其中（11：32）。我们会问，上帝公平吗？为何底波拉不在其中？其实，底波拉和巴拉都是作神的工作，这些人都是被神记念的。并且底波拉的使命是培养、建立巴拉的信心。当她看到巴拉成为信心的领袖时，这岂不是对她最大的安慰和肯定吗？

### 挑战：神能使用你！你需要兴起！

神可以兴起一切人为他服侍，神要使用你。神可以使用左手便利的以笏、神可以使用为人之妻的底波拉、也可以使用基尼人雅亿、神可以使用少年大卫打败歌利亚。神真正要找的是愿意顺服他，相信他的大能、并甘愿为他献上的人。神要使用你！有位参加祷告会的姐妹是作清洁工作的。她祷告说：“主啊，你不仅让我打扫外在的卫生，更要让我打扫人心灵的卫生；我要为整栋楼里人的灵魂守望祷告，为他们的救恩祷告”。这位姐妹就是天国的大祭司，她的服侍就是神所喜悦的！

有一段时间，教会晨祷会特别为更多弟兄兴起来祷告！感谢教会中所有姐妹的服侍，如果没有你们的服侍，教会无法运作。但我们要祷告主兴起更多弟兄能愿意为主甘心摆上服侍。有错误的观念认为，祷告是姐妹的事，服侍是姊妹的事。我们忘记了夏娃犯罪的最直接原因就是亚当失职，没有看管好伊甸园，而给魔鬼留下可趁之机。 如果弟兄不被兴起作领袖，家庭怎能得胜？教会怎能复兴？愿主在这个时代将更多弟兄兴起来，承担责任，带领家庭的敬拜，带动教会的事工，为基督影响这个时代。

**最后，让我们向神祷告说：主啊，兴起我们，像你在古时兴起底波拉、巴拉和雅亿一样！“耶和华啊，愿你的仇敌都这样灭亡！愿爱你的人如日头出现，光辉烈烈”（士5：31）。阿门！                                                      （注：2025年3月2日讲章，李春海牧师）**
