### Jackie回答：“结婚了。”

### Trust in the Lord:

My Calling and Service

Gregory Meeks

Originally my wife and I were scheduled to speak, but Jackie, my wife, is unable to be here today.  She is busy taking care of her 95 year old father, who has dementia.  She sends her regrets.

Jackie and I met while we were students at Quachita Baptist University.  Before attending Quachita, I was attending Nicholls State University in Louisiana.  While in Louisiana I surrendered to full-time Christian service.  So I felt it best to transfer from Nicholls to a Christian university.  Since I had family living near the school I decided to go to Quachita.  Before going to Quachita, I hadn’t considered missions, but while there many of my friends were the children of missionaries.  It was from them that I saw the need to help educate these children while their parents were on the mission field.

Jackie and I dated for about a year and then we began talking about marriage and what we wanted to do with our lives.  We were both delighted to find out that we both had a calling to do ministry overseas.  Jackie had surrendered to being a missionary at a very young age.  This was just an affirmation that God had brought us together.

We were married in January of 1976.  Immediately after our marriage we began corresponding with the Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention.  Since then the name has change to the International Mission Board.  They informed us of the qualifications to be considered to be appointed.  Two years experience in your field, a masters degree and 20 hours of seminary.

To meet the requirements I completed my masters degree in educational administration and began teaching.  I taught for two years and then from a miracle from God at the age of 24 I was able to move to a principal position.

Our first interview with the International Mission Board was for a teaching position in the Philippines.  We were disappointed when they turned us down.  They thought I would be more suited for an administrative position and at that time there were no administrative positions available.  So we returned home with our heads hung low.

Sometime later we were asked to return for a second interview.  A principal position had opened  up for Morrison Academy located in Taiwan.  I had my master’ degree in educational administration, I had two years experience as a school principal.  All I lacked was seminary.  At the end of the school year, I resigned and we moved to New Orleans to attend New Orleans Theological Seminary.

About half way through my second semester, I received word from the Mission Board that the principal at Morrison Academy in Taiwan had decided to stay on, and the position was no longer available.  And there were no other administrative positions anywhere in the world.  That resulted in me questioning God.  I’ve quit my job.  God, why am I here.  What do you have planned for us?  Why has this happened?

Then about three weeks later the mission board contacted us again.  Well, an opening for a school principal had just opened up.  It was for the American School in Beirut, Lebanon.  This was in 1981 and if you didn’t know Lebanon was in the middle of civil war at the time.  We weren’t thrilled with this opportunity, but we were resigned to do God’s will.  We told God, if this is where you want us to go, we will go, but we don’t like it.

I finished out the semester and we came home to Arkansas for the Christmas break.  When we returned to New Orleans after the break there was a letter waiting for us.  It was from the superintendent of Morrison Academy in Taiwan.  He shared that he was excited that we were coming to Taiwan and looked forward to our arrival.  This of course was a big surprise for us.  I called the mission board and asked what is going on?  Taiwan thinks I am coming.  The board did some checking and it turned out that the principal was staying on at the school, but not as the principal, but as a teacher.  The principal position was open.  We were thankful we didn’t have to serve in Beirut.  And we were thankful that God gave us the opportunity to serve in Taiwan.

We were appointed by the Mission Board to Taiwan in the fall of 1981.  We flew into the Taoyuan airport on January 7 of 1982.  After we completed customs and walked into the airport terminal, my first impression of Taiwan was, “Man, there is a lot of Chinese here.”

We got settled into our new home and promptly started language school.  We were instructed in Beiping Hwar.  Of course, being in Taiwan no one spoke Beiping Hwar.  They all spoke Chinese with a lazy tongue.  So, we also eventually picked up the Taiwan accent.

Since my wife is not hear, I’ll tell this language school story on her.  We would be with a tutor for four hours in each morning.  In the afternoon we would study the new vocabulary and go out on the street and try and talk with neighbors.  I was 28 years old at the time.  One day Jackie was talking with one of the neighbor shop owners.  They were making small talk.

The shop owner asked, “Are you married?”

Jackie responded, “married.”

“How old is your husband?”

“82! Really?”

“Really 82.”

We eventually finished language school and I began my job as the principal of the Morrison Academy Taipei Campus.  Morrison Academy is an international Christian school established specifically for the education of missionary children. Jackie was busy raising our two children who were both born in Taipei.  She was also meeting and ministering to Chinese ladies.  We were both involved in assisting with a new Chinese church plant (Jung Yang Jienshien Hwei).

After about 7 years on the mission field we were told from the Mission Board administration that they wanted to begin to move out of institutions, such as schools, radio TV work, Christian bookstores, etc.  That meant that there was a possibility that I would need to leave Taiwan.  I determined at that point to take what is called a study furlough.  It would allow me to work on a doctoral degree in education while still on salary.  My thinking was if I ever had to leave the field, then I could get a job teaching at university and that would give me an opportunity to minister to Chinese students who were studying in the US.  I finished my PhD in short order and returned to the Taiwan.  I returned to the same position I was at previously.  After a year, the superintendent resigned and I was asked to fill that position.  I was then responsible for the oversight of the three campuses located in Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung.  I served in this position the last ten years of our stay in Taiwan.  Our daughter graduated from high school at Morrison in the spring of 2002.  After her graduation we returned to the States to get her situated in college.  Our son at this time had just completed the tenth grade.  We settled into a home in Conway, Arkansas that was for missionaries on home assignment. Our daughter decided to attend Missouri State University in Springfield, MO.  Our son went to Conway High School.  He had been in Morrison where there were about 25 in his class.  Conway had about a thousand in his 11-grade class.  The first day he came home from school I asked him, “Did you meet anyone today?”  He said, “Yeah, but I’ll never see them again.”  He was a little overwhelmed to say the least.  He eventually realized he like being in the US and wanted to finish his high years here.  We were agreeable to that.  But, that meant I would have to go off salary with the mission board for a year.

So, I began looking for a school administrative position.  I had a few interviews and actually was offered a principal position in Springfield, MO where my daughter was. But, God didn’t give me peace about it.  And even though I didn’t have any other offers, I turned it down.

Living in Conway, knowing that Beebe was close by I applied for a teaching position at ASU Beebe.  About this time Jackie’s mother had a heart attack.  She was in St Bernard Hospital in Jonesboro for about a month.  During this time Jackie lived out of the car and stayed with her mother most of the day and night. And it became obvious that Jackie and I needed to stay in the States so she could help take care of her mother.

In the midst of all this I was contacted that ASU wanted to interview me for the teaching position.  The interview went well and I and the kids returned to Taiwan to pack up the things that we would take back to the States.  The rest of our belongings we either gave away or sold.  While still in Taiwan I received a phone call from the Teacher Education Department Chair.  She said I’ve got good news and bad news.  OK, what’s the good news?  We want to hire you.  So, what’s the bad new?  We don’t want you in Beebe we want you at the main campus in Jonesboro.  So actually that was good news and more good news.  Being in Jonesboro we would be about thirty minutes from Jackie’s parents house.  For the next year, most of Jackie’s time was spent helping take care of her mom.  She eventually improved and lived another 4 years.  I’m convinced if Jackie hadn’t been there for her she wouldn’t have made it but a month or two.  In fact when she went back in for a check up the next year, Jackie overheard one of the nurses tell another nurse, “Isn’t she the one that was suppose to die?”

I started my responsibilities at ASU, teaching and also supervising student teacher interns.  But, I was surprised that there were only a few Chinese professors.  And if there were any Chinese students, I never ran across them.  My thinking that I could minister to Chinese students just wasn’t happening.  My lament to God at the time was, “God, I know this is where I am supposed to be, but I don’t understand.”  This went on for a couple of years.  I believe it was my third year at ASU that a new provost came in.  He had been brought in with the explicit purpose of bringing in foreign students.  He had numerous contacts in China and within a year there were over 800 Chinese students attending ASU.  It became clear why God had placed Jackie and I in Jonesboro.  Not only to help her mom, but also to minister to the Chinese students and the Chinese community.

At the time, Jackie and I were serving at a mission church not far from ASU.  We were both teaching Bible classes.  Jackie was teaching a teenage girls class and I was teaching a young adult class.  My class soon became an international class made up of mostly Chinese students.

I need to share with you the first baptism that we had from this class.  One Sunday a new student showed up, Jason Mao.  After the class was over one of our co-workers, Zhuang Jin, came over and said you need to talk with this student.  I talked with him briefly and we arranged to meet the next day for lunch.  I spent some time going through the plan of salvation and step along the way he had already completed.  Are you a sinner?  Yes.  Have you repented and turn to Jesus?  Yes,  I got all the way through all my questions and it was evident that he already was a believer.  I asked him how did you get to this point?  He replied, “Before I left China my sister, who isn’t a Christian, gave me a Bible and told me to read it to better understand American culture.  Well, I read it and I believed it.  Jason was baptized a few days later.  Praise God!  That just illustrates the power of God’s Word for those who will read it!

I mentioned Zhuang Jin, her and another coworker ,Grace Liouh were also a great help.  Jin and her husband Jay and Grace and her husband Wilson and Jackie and I were encouraged to move our Bible study to a church.  All of us attended a church planting seminar and that allowed us to better organize into a church rather than simply a Bible study.  To begin with, we had a time of praise music and then Bible study.  Ted Lamb, whom many of you may know, encouraged us if given a choice between preaching and Bible Study to focus on the Bible study.  We continued with this format for a number years.  Eventually, preaching was added.  I never was trained in preaching and since my background is in education, I have been more of a teaching pastor.

As we have grown we have added a teenage boys class, a teenage girl class, a 1st through 6th grade class and a nursery.  Since most of our children are primarily English speakers these classes are conducted in English.  Not only do we have a Chinese class for adults, but we also have an English class for those who want Bible instruction in English.

Over time, the Chinese student enrollment declined to where there are currently about 30 Chinese students attending ASU.  During our services as the ASU student attendance decreased our attendance of adults from the university and business community has increased.  Pre-covid we were running about 70 weekly in attendance.  We still haven’t fully recovered from that.  We are currently running about 50 in attendance.  And recently we are getting a number of new people, most who are not Christians, join us.

I mentioned Jason Mao, he was baptized in September 20 of 2010.  Since then we have baptized 62 new believers.  Those baptized include students, university faculty as well as business people.

God has been faithful.  Not only in growing our church, but God has been faithful in Jackie and my life.  My life verse is Proverbs 3:5-6 “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.”

I will be 71 next month and as I look back on my life I can see God directing me along the way.  John1, identifies Jesus as the True Light.  If you look to him, if you commit your ways to him he will illuminate the path you are to go.  How does he do that?  The Word of God gives us direction and how we are to live.  If you aren’t spending time daily in the Word your missing the instruction you need to navigate this life the way God intended.  Not only is it imperative to saturate your mind with the Word, but the Holy Spirit will also guide you through the thick and thin of life.  If you want a straight path through this life, a life that is abundant and rewarding, then trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him.

(This testimony was shared by Rev. Greg Meeks at the Fall Retreat of Little Rock Immanuel Chinese Baptist Church on October 19. We are very thankful for them and their ministry)

“认定主”

——我的呼召与服侍

米国瑞

我和妻子原本计划今天进行分享，但我妻子 Jackie 今天无法到场。她正在忙于照顾患有痴呆症的95岁父亲。她对此表示遗憾。

我和Jackie 是在沃希托浸会大学（Quachita Baptist University）读书时认识的。在进入沃希托之前，我在路易斯安那州的尼科尔斯州立大学（Nicholls State University）上学。在路易斯安那州期间，我全身心投入服侍基督。所以我觉得最好从尼科尔斯转到基督教大学。因为我的家人住在学校附近，所以我决定去沃希托 。在去沃希托之前，我从未考虑过作传教士，但在那里时，我的许多朋友都是传教士的孩子。从他们身上，我看到了在父母在传教期间帮助教育这些孩子的必要性。

我和Jackie交往了大约一年，然后我们开始谈婚论嫁以及我们想要如何度过自己的一生。我们很高兴地发现，我们俩都渴望去海外传教。Jackie在很小的时候就投身于传教事业。这恰恰证明了是上帝让我们走到一起的。

我们于 1976 年 1 月结婚。婚后我们立即开始与美南浸信会的海外宣教部（the Foreign Mission Board）通信。从那时起，该委员会的名称改为国际宣教部（the International Mission Board）。他们告诉我们要考虑差派的资格：两年相关领域的工作经验，硕士学位和 20 小时的神学院学习。

为了满足要求，我完成了教育管理硕士学位并开始教学。我教了两年书，然后，在 24 岁时，上帝给了我一个神迹，让我能够升任校长职位。

我们第一次参加国际宣教部的面试是为了应聘菲律宾的教师职位。他们拒绝了我们，我们很失望。他们认为我更适合行政职位，而当时没有行政职位空缺。所以我们垂头丧气地回家了。

过了一段时间，我们被要求再来参加第二次面试。台湾的马礼逊学校（Morrison Academy）有校长职位空缺。我拥有教育管理硕士学位，有两年校长经验。我唯一缺少的是神学院学历。学年结束时，我辞职了，我们搬到新奥尔良，就读新奥尔良浸信会神学院

大约在第二学期的一半时间，我收到宣教部的消息，台湾马礼逊学院的校长决定留任，这个职位不再空缺。而且世界上没有其他行政职位。这让我开始质疑上帝。我辞职了。上帝，我为什么在这里。你为我们计划了什么？为什么会发生这种事？

大约三周后，宣教部再次联系我们。当时，学校刚招收校长。是黎巴嫩贝鲁特的美国学校。那是 1981 年，如果你不知道的话，当时黎巴嫩正处于内战之中。我们对这个机会并不感到兴奋，但我们只好听从上帝安排。我们告诉上帝，如果这是你想让我们去的地方，我们会去，但我们不喜欢。

我完成了学期的学习，然后我们回到阿肯色州过圣诞假期。假期结束后，我们回到新奥尔良，有一封信在等着我们。这是台湾马礼逊学院的校长写的。他说他很高兴我们来台湾，并期待着我们的到来。这当然对我们来说是一个大惊喜。我打电话给宣教部，问发生了什么事？台湾以为我会来。宣教部做了一些调查，结果发现校长会继续留在学校，但不是校长，而是老师。校长职位空缺。我们很庆幸我们不必在贝鲁特服侍。我们也很感谢上帝给了我们在台湾服侍的机会。

我们于1981年秋天被宣教部指派去台湾。1982年1月7日，我们飞抵桃园机场。办完海关，走进机场航站楼后，我对台湾的第一印象是，“天哪，这里好多中国人啊。”

我们安顿下来后，很快就开始上语言学校。我们学的是北平话。当然，在台湾没有人说北平话。他们都说着懒洋洋的中文。所以，我们最终也学会了台湾腔。

因为我妻子不在，所以我就把这个语言学校的故事讲给你们听。我们每天早上都会和一位导师一起上四个小时的课。下午我们会学习新词汇，然后上街去试着和邻居们聊天。当时我 28 岁。有一天，Jackie和邻居家的一位店主聊天。他们正在闲聊。

### 店主问：“你结婚了吗？”

“您丈夫多大了？”

“他82岁了。”

“82！真的吗？”

“真的，82。”

我们最终完成了语言学校的学业，我开始担任马礼逊学院台北分校的校长。马礼逊学院是一所国际基督教学校，专门为传教士子女的教育而设立。Jackie 忙于抚养我们两个出生在台北的孩子。她还与中国姐妹见面并服侍她们。我们都参与了协助建立一个新的中国植堂（中阳浸信会）。

在传教区工作了大约 7 年后，宣教部的领导告诉我们，他们想开始撤出学校、广播电视工作、基督教书店等机构。这意味着我可能需要离开台湾。我当时有一个学习述职（a study furlough）。这将使我能够继续攻读教育博士学位，同时还能领取薪水。我的想法是，如果我不得不离开这个领域，那么我可以找一份大学教书的工作，这将使我有机会为在美国学习的中国学生服侍。我很快就完成了博士学位并返回台湾。我回到了以前的职位。一年后，校长辞职，我被邀请填补这个职位。我当时负责监督位于台北、台中和高雄的三个校区。我们在台湾的最后十年，我一直担任这个职位。 2002 年春天，我们的女儿从马礼逊的高中毕业。毕业后，我们回到美国，帮她安排大学入学。当时，我们的儿子刚刚读完十年级。我们在阿肯色州康威的一所为回国传教士准备的住所安顿下来。我们的女儿决定就读密苏里州斯普林菲尔德的密苏里州立大学。我们的儿子就读于康威高中。他曾在马礼逊上学，当时他的班上大约有 25 名学生。而康威11 年级的班上大约有 1000 人。他放学回家的第一天，我问他：“你今天见到什么人了吗？”他说：“见到了，但我再也见不到他们了。”可以说，他有点不知所措。最终，他意识到他喜欢待在美国，想在这里完成他的高中学业。我们同意了。但是，这意味着我必须在宣教部停止工作一年。

于是，我开始寻找学校行政职位。我参加了几次面试，实际上我女儿所在的密苏里州斯普林菲尔德市获得了校长职位。但是，上帝并没有让我对此感到安心。尽管我没有其他职位，但我还是拒绝了。

我住在康威，知道比比（Beebe）就在附近，于是就申请了阿肯色州立大学比比分校的教职。就在那时，Jackie的母亲心脏病发作。她在琼斯博罗的圣伯纳德医院（St Bernard Hospital）住了大约一个月。在此期间，Jackie住在车里，白天和晚上大部分时间都和母亲待在一起。很明显，Jackie和我需要留在美国，这样她才能帮忙照顾母亲。

在这期间，有人联系我，说阿肯色州立大学想面试我，让我担任教师一职。面试进行得很顺利，我和孩子们回到台湾，收拾东西准备带回美国。我们剩下的东西要么送人，要么卖掉。还在台湾的时候，我接到了师范教育系主任的电话。她说我有一个好消息和一个坏消息。好消息是什么？我们想聘用你。那么，坏消息是什么？我们不想让你留在比比，我们想让你留在琼斯博罗（Jonosboro）的主校区。所以实际上这是好消息和更多的好消息。在琼斯博罗，我们离Jackie父母家大约三十分钟的路程。在接下来的一年里，Jackie大部分时间都在帮助照顾她的母亲。她最终好转，又活了四年。我相信，如果没有Jackie在她身边，她活不过一两个月。事实上，当她第二年回去检查时，Jackie无意中听到一名护士对另一名护士说：“她不是那个快死的人了吗？”

我开始在阿肯色州立大学工作，教书，同时指导实习教师。但令我惊讶的是，那里只有几位中国教授。如果有中国学生，我从未遇到过。我以为我可以为中国学生服侍，但这个想法根本行不通。我当时向上帝哀叹：“上帝，我知道我应该在这里，但我不明白。”这种情况持续了几年。我记得，那是我在阿肯色州立大学的第三年，一位新教务长上任。他被任命的明确目的是招收外国学生。他在中国有很多人脉，一年之内，就有 800 多名中国学生就读于阿肯色州立大学。上帝把 Jackie 和我放在琼斯博罗的原因显而易见。不仅是为了帮助她的妈妈，也是为了服侍中国学生和华人社区。

当时，Jackie和我在阿肯色州立大学附近的一个福音堂里服侍。我们都在教圣经课。Jackie正在教一个十几岁的女孩。我当时教的是青少年班，我的班很快就变成了一个国际班，大部分学生都是中国学生。

我需要与你们分享我们班上第一个受洗的学生。一个星期天，来了一位新学生，Jason Mao（毛志强）。下课后，我们的一位同工庄进过来告诉我，你需要和这个学生谈谈。我和他简短地交谈了一下，然后我们约好第二天一起吃午饭。我花了一些时间讲解救赎计划，并按照他已经完成的步骤进行。”你是罪人吗？” “是的。” “你悔改并转向耶稣了吗？” “是的。”我把所有的问题都问完了，很明显他已经是一个信徒了。我问他你是怎么走到这一步的？他回答说：“在我离开中国之前，我的姐姐不是基督徒，她给了我一本圣经，并告诉我要读圣经，以便更好地了解美国文化。好吧，我读了圣经，并且相信了圣经”。几天后 Jason 就受洗了。赞美上帝！这恰恰说明了上帝的话语对那些愿意阅读它的人的力量！

我提到了庄进，她和另一位同工 Grace Liouh也帮了大忙。庄进和她的丈夫 Jay、Grace 和她的丈夫 Wilson、Jackie 和我受到鼓励将我们的圣经学习转移到教会。我们所有人都参加了一个教会植堂研讨会，这让我们能够更好地组织成一个教会，而不仅仅是一个圣经学习。首先，我们有一段赞美音乐的时间，然后是圣经学习。你们许多人可能都认识林彬牧师，他鼓励我们，如果让我们在讲道和圣经学习之间做出选择，就专注于圣经学习。我们继续这种形式好几年了。最后，我们加入了讲道。我从未接受过讲道方面的培训，而且由于我的背景是教育，所以我更像是一个教育的牧师。

随着我们的成长，我们增加了一个青少年男孩班、一个青少年女孩班、一个 1至6年级班和一个托儿所。由于我们的大多数孩子主要讲英语，因此这些课程都以英语授课。我们不仅有针对成人的中文班，而且还有针对那些想要用英语学习圣经的人的英语班。

随着时间的推移，中国学生的入学人数下降到目前约有 30 名中国学生就读于阿肯色州立大学。在我们礼拜期间，随着阿肯色州立大学学生的入学率下降，来自大学和商界的成年人的出席率却有所增加。在疫情之前，我们每周大约有 70人参加。我们还没有完全恢复过来。目前我们大约有 50 人参加。最近，我们又有了一些新人加入我们，其中大多数不是基督徒。

我提到毛志强，他于2010年9月20日受洗。从那时起，我们已经为62名新信徒施洗。受洗者包括学生、大学教师以及商界人士。

上帝是忠实的。上帝不仅在教会的发展上忠实，而且在 Jackie 和我的生命中也忠实。我的人生格言是箴言 3:5-6：“你要专心仰赖耶和华，不可倚靠自己的聪明；你一切所行的事都要认定他，他必指引你的路。”

下个月我就要 71 岁了，回顾自己的一生，我可以看到上帝一直在指引我前行。约翰福音 1 章将耶稣称为真光。如果你仰望他，如果你将自己的道路交托给他，他就会照亮你要走的路。他是怎么做到的？上帝的话语为我们指明方向，告诉我们应该如何生活。如果你没有每天花时间研读上帝的话语，那么你就错过了按照上帝的意图驾驭人生所需的指导。不仅要用上帝的话语充实你的思想，圣灵也会引导你度过人生的艰难困苦。如果你想要一生走一条笔直的道路，过上富足而有意义的生活，那么就要专心仰赖主，不可依靠自己的聪明；在你一切所行的事上都要认定他。
