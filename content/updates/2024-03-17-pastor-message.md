The “Holy Spirit” in 1 Corinthians Chapter 2

### Question: Who is the Holy Spirit?

Answer: “The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, fully divine. He inspired holy men of old to write the Scriptures. Through illumination He enables men to understand truth. He exalts Christ. He convicts men of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment. He calls men to the Saviour, and effects regeneration. At the moment of regeneration He baptizes every believer into the Body of Christ. He cultivates Christian character, comforts believers, and bestows the spiritual gifts by which they serve God through His church. He seals the believer unto the day of final redemption. His presence in the Christian is the guarantee that God will bring the believer into the fullness of the stature of Christ. He enlightens and empowers the believer and the church in worship, evangelism, and service.”                                     (Baptist Faith &amp; Message 2000)

**The church needs more teachings on the truth about the Holy Spirit. Many Chinese churches’ understanding of the Holy Spirit remains at the level of knowledge and concept, inadvertently driving the Holy Spirit out of the church. They overlook the lively and free work of the Holy Spirit, resulting in the church becoming a dry and sheer doctrinal and theoretical practice. Pastors' preaching becomes mere lecturing, and believers lose their passion and ability to witness for the Lord. Some may only associate the work of the Holy Spirit with miracles, healing, speaking in tongues, or casting out demons, considering those who highlight the Holy Spirit as odd. While the work of the Holy Spirit indeed includes these aspects, it is not limited to them. We need a comprehensive and deep understanding of the Holy Spirit, building an intimate relationship with Him, and experiencing more of His power and grace in our lives. 1 Corinthians 2 talks extensively about the Holy Spirit, which is helpful for us to have a correct understanding of Him.**
• Preaching is a Demonstration of the Spirit and Power (2:4)

The ancient Greeks valued rhetoric and public speaking highly, with figures like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle considered foundational to Western eloquence. The Corinthians were influenced by Greek philosophers and admired rhetoric and debate. However, Paul emphasized that he did not rely on the wisdom of the Greeks but on Christ Jesus and Him crucified. He did not depend on human knowledge and eloquence but on the demonstration of the Spirit and power. Excellent eloquence can persuade the mind, but only the Spirit and power of God can convict the soul, leading to a real repentance and turning to Christ. Preachers should emulate Paul, believing that the Word of God is superior to all and relying on the Spirit of God to convince hearts. When there is the Word, there is the Spirit; when there is the Spirit, there is power; when there is power, there is effectiveness, and with effectiveness, glory is attributed to God.

• The Spirit Reveals the Mysteries of God (2:10)

“That is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly. In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ, which was not made known to people in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God’s holy apostles and prophets. This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are heirs together with Israel, members together of one body, and sharers together in the promise in Christ Jesus” (NIV Eph 3: 4-6). For believers, the Holy Spirit opens our hearts, enabling us to understand and receive the Gospel of Christ. For seekers, we need to continue to pray for the Holy Spirit to open their hearts, making them soft and humble, so they can receive the illumination and truth of the Holy Spirit.

• The Spirit of God Knows the Things of God (2:11)

Paul was a man who understood the Holy Spirit. He repented and received the call to preach on the road to Damascus when the Lord's great light shone upon him. The Lord appeared to him and gave him “visions and revelations” (2 Corinthians 12:1). Among the Corinthians, he demonstrated the credentials of an apostle “with great perseverance, signs, wonders, and miracles” (2 Corinthians 12:12).

Every believer desires to understand more about the things of God. As Paul said, only the spirit within a person truly understands the things of a human being; similarly, only the Spirit of God truly understands the things of God (1 Corinthians 2:11). The Spirit of God must fully manifest the nature of God, including His love, righteousness, goodness, holiness, faithfulness, and wisdom. Any practice that contradicts the attributes of God cannot be from the Spirit of God. Apostle John also reminds us not to believe every spirit in the world but to test whether the spirit is from the Holy Spirit. A spirit from God will surely acknowledge that Jesus came in the flesh (1 John 4:1-3). Conversely, those deceived by false teachings may appear friendly, but they are influenced by evil spirits (such as Eastern Lightning, also known as Almighty God and Falun Gong), because they do not acknowledge Jesus as the Savior but regard some man as their Savior.

• Explain Spiritual Things with Spiritual Words (2:13)

When leading Bible studies or sharing in the church, the most important thing is the opening and guidance of the Holy Spirit. Here, an important principle of interpretation is mentioned: “Explaining spiritual things with words taught by the Spirit.” The words taught by the Spirit are not necessarily profound and difficult to understand. Just as Jesus preached, he often used everyday examples to explain the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, such as flowers in the field, birds in the sky, farmers planting, fishermen fishing, merchants trading, and a grain of wheat. These examples are simple, easy to understand, and deeply moving. Chinese people can use idioms, stories, and proverbs unique to the Chinese culture to clarify the truth of the Lord. Through the background of Chinese culture, the Gospel can penetrate into our blood and into the marrow and joints of our bones.

• Spiritual People can Discern All Things (2:14-15)

I remember when studying at Nanjing Union Theological Seminary, some classmates mocked the term “spiritual” and often joked with phrases like “oh, you're so spiritual.” This is not right. Christians should pursue becoming spiritual people. Otherwise, we are no different from the world. Those who pursue spirituality and live in the Spirit will have many special insights. They see things differently from the world (2 Kings 6:17); they often have unique insights and judgment; they can discern spirits, preach with the power of the Lord, and the Lord will also work through them to perform miracles and wonders; sometimes, they can even see the hidden sins within people, just as Peter saw the greed in Ananias' heart (Acts 5:3-4).

• Spiritual People Have the Mind of Christ (2:16)

---
**Those who enjoy arguing, envy, and strife, and are unwilling to humble themselves, confess their sins, and live in harmony with others, are not truly spiritual. A genuine spiritual person should have the heart and life of Christ. Elder Guo Shouzhong, whom I mentioned two weeks ago (see Pastor's Words on March 3), not only possesses spiritual gifts but also a humble life. He confessed sins, repented, lived in holiness, and loved others. When we learn from such an elder, we are not to imitate his external gifts but to cultivate an inner spiritual life, pray more, empty ourselves, love sacrificially, let the Holy Spirit fill us, and live out Christ.**
From 1 Corinthians Chapter 2, we see that preaching relies on the demonstration of the Spirit’s power, the Spirit reveals the mysteries of God to us, the Spirit of God knows the things of God, when interpreting scripture, we should use spiritual words to explain spiritual things, spiritual people can discern all things, and spiritual people have the mind of Christ. What we need to do today is to rely more on the Holy Spirit to accomplish great things in every aspect of our lives and ministries, and to manifest the glory of God. May the Lord bless us!

《哥林多前书》2章中的“圣灵”

### 问：圣灵是谁？

答：“圣灵是神的灵，完全的神。祂感动旧约圣人写成旧约圣经，祂藉著光照使人明白真理。祂高举基督，使人为罪，为义，为审判自责。祂呼召人归向救主，使人重生。在重生的时候，祂为每位信徒施浸归入基督。祂孕育基督徒的品格，安慰他们，将属灵恩赐赏给他们，使他们藉著教会服事神。祂给每位信徒印记直至后救赎的日子。祂活在信徒心中，保证信徒更肖乎基督的形像。祂在崇拜，传道，与服事中光照并加力给信徒和教会”。              (浸信会信仰与信息 (2000年)

教会需要更多教导圣灵方面的真理。许多华人教会对圣灵的认识只停留在知识和概念的层面，在不知不觉中将圣灵赶出教会，忽略了圣灵活泼自由的工作，使教会变得教条化、理论化，牧者的讲道成了说教，信徒丧失为主作见证的热心和能力。另有一些人可能一提到圣灵便会只是单方面将圣灵的工作与神迹、医治、说方言或赶鬼等联系起来，认为强调圣灵的人会让人觉得怪怪的。圣灵的工作的确包括这些方面，但并不全面。我们需要全面、深入地认识圣灵，与圣灵建立亲密的关系，并在生活中更多经历圣灵的大能和恩典。《哥林多前书》第2章多次讲到圣灵，这段经文对我们正确认识圣灵有帮助。

### 讲道是圣灵和大能的明证（2：4）

古希腊人一向重视修辞和演讲，希腊哲人中苏格拉底、柏拉图、亚里士多德被视为西方口才艺术的奠基式人物。哥林多人也深受希腊智者影响，崇尚修辞与辩论。然而，保罗强调，在这些人中间他高举的不是希腊人的智慧，而是基督耶稣并他钉十字架；他依靠的不是人的知识和口才，乃是圣灵和大能的明证。优秀的雄辩能折服人的思想，但只有圣灵和上帝的大能才能折服人的灵魂，使人认罪悔改，归向基督。讲道人要效法保罗，相信神的道高于一切，依靠神的灵折服人心。传道人有道就有圣灵，有圣灵就有道，有圣灵就有能力，有能力就有果效，有果效后将荣耀归与神。

### 圣灵显明神的奥秘（2: 10）

神是奥秘的。自旧约众先知以来，神最大的奥秘就是耶稣基督十字架所成全的福音。“你们念了，就能晓得我深知基督的奥秘。 这奥秘在以前的世代没有叫人知道，像如今借着圣灵启示他的圣使徒和先知一样。 这奥秘就是外邦人在基督耶稣里，借着福音，得以同为后嗣，同为一体，同蒙应许”（弗3：4-6）。对于信徒来说，圣灵开启我们的心，使我们可以明白和领受基督的福音。对于慕道友来说，我们需要继续求圣灵开启他们，使他们的心灵柔软谦卑，从而领受圣灵的光照和真理。

### 神的灵知道神的事（2: 11）

保罗是一个理解圣灵的人。他在大马色路上蒙主大光的照耀而悔改领受传道的呼召。主多次向他“显现和启示”（林后12：1）。他在哥林多人中间，“用百般的忍耐，借着神迹、奇事，异能显出使徒的凭据来”（林后12：12） 。每个信徒都想多了解神的事情。“解铃还须系铃人”。如保罗所说，只有人里面的灵才真正了解人的事；同样，只有神的灵才真正了解神的事（林前2：11）。神的灵一定完全彰显神的性情，包括神的慈爱、公义、良善、圣洁、信实、智慧等。凡与神的属性相违背的做法，一定不是从神的灵来的。使徒约翰也提醒我们，世上各种的灵我们不可都信，总要试验那灵是否出于圣灵的不是。出于圣灵的一定承认耶稣是道成肉身来的（约一4：1-3）。相反，受异教迷惑者或许为人友善，但却受了邪灵的唆使（比如东方闪电-又叫全能神和法轮功等），因为他们不认耶稣是救主、却将人视为救主。

### 用属灵的话解释属灵的事(2: 13)

在教会带领查经或分享，最需要的是圣灵的开启和引导。这里讲到一条重要的解经原则：“用圣灵所指教的言语，将属灵的话解释属灵的事”。圣灵指示的话语不一定是深奥难懂的。就像耶稣讲道一样，他常用生活的例子讲解天国的奥秘，比如野地里的花、空中的小鸟、农夫种田、渔夫打鱼、商人作买卖、一粒麦子等，这些例子浅显易懂、深入人心。华人可以用上帝赐予华人特有的成语故事、谚语等将主的真理讲明出来，华人借助中国文化的背景阐释福音才更能深入我们的血液里和我们的骨髓与骨节中。

### 属灵的人能看透万事(2: 14-15)

记得在南京神学院读书时，有些同学嘲笑“属灵”这个词，并常拿“就你属灵”这样的话开玩笑。这是不对的。基督徒就应该追求成为属灵人。否则，我们与世人便没有区别了。追求属灵、活在圣灵中的人，会有许多特别的洞见力。他们与世人看问题的眼光不同（王下6：17）；他们常有独到的见解和判断力；他们可以分辨诸灵，讲道有主的能力，主也会借他们显出神迹和异能；他们有时甚至可以看出人里面隐藏的罪恶，就如彼得看到亚拿尼亚心中的贪婪一样（徒5：3-4）。

### 属灵的人有基督的心(2: 16)

喜欢争辩、嫉妒纷争、不愿谦卑认罪与人和睦的人，不是一个真正的属灵人。一个真正的属灵人应该拥有基督的心肠和基督的生命。我在两周前讲到的郭守忠长老（参3月3日牧者之言），他不仅有属灵的恩赐，更有谦卑的生命。他认罪、悔改、圣洁、爱人。我们向这样的长辈学习时，不是要模仿他外在的恩赐，而是要操练内在属灵生命，更多祷告、倒空自己，舍己爱人，让圣灵充满，活出基督。

从哥林多前书第2章中我们看到，讲道要靠圣灵大能的明证，圣灵会向我们显明神的奥秘，神的灵知道神的事，解经时要用属灵的话解释属灵的事，属灵的人能看透万事，并且属灵的人有基督的心肠。我们今天所要作的就是：在生活和侍奉的各个层面上多多依靠圣灵成就大事，彰显神荣。愿主赐福我们！

周一到周五早5：00，周六早6：00。每次一个小时。周日没有。由弟兄姐妹轮流带领，欢迎弟兄姐妹参加。Zoom ID:501.501.7777,密码:777。
