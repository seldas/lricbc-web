Fear God; Honor the King

The most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever He will, and setteth up over it the basest of men. – Daniel 4: 17

As the campaign for the next president of the United States gathers momentum, personal opinions are often freely expressed about the qualifications of the candidates. The comments frequently degenerate into severe criticisms by those who are positive that their choices are better than the opponents. Unfortunately, this tendency all too often is found among those who profess Christianity.

A little before the second US presidential election over two centuries ago, a newspaper vilified John Adams as “a gross hypocrite, one of the most egregious fools, and a strange compound of ignorance and ferocity, and of deceit and weakness.” Adams was one who had signed the Declaration of Independence, and under President Washington he had served as an able foreign minister to both England and France. He never responded to his character assassins; and after becoming the second president, Adams quietly proceeded to excel during four years of distinguished service to the American nation.

While the qualifications and character of many public officials may seem questionable, how often do we pray for them instead of berating them? Paul wrote, “I exhort therefore, that … prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life” (1 Timothy 2: 1-2). All authority is delegated by God.

The best way we as Christians can vote is on our knees, not in the ballot box, always including an earnest, “Not as I will, but as thou wilt” (Matthew 26: 39). God’s decisions can never be defeated by voting.                                         Peter Lewis – Halsey, OR

The Lord of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? And his hand is stretched out, and

### who shall turn it back? - Isaiah 14: 27

Friendly reminder: This devotion reminds us to pray earnestly for the Presidential Election and encourages us to vote if we can!

敬畏上帝，尊敬国王

至高者在人的国中掌权，要将国赐与谁，就赐予谁，或立极卑贱的人执掌国权。——但以理书 4:17

随着美国下一任总统竞选活动的势头越来越猛，人们常常自由地表达对候选人资格的个人意见。那些确信自己的选择比对手更好的人，这些评论常常演变成严厉的批评。不幸的是，这种倾向在那些自称信奉基督教的人中经常出现。

两个多世纪前，在第二次美国总统大选前不久，一家报纸诋毁约翰·亚当斯为“一个彻头彻尾的伪君子，一个最令人震惊的傻瓜，一个无知和残暴、欺骗和软弱的奇怪混合体”。亚当斯是《独立宣言》的签署人之一，在华盛顿总统的领导下，他曾担任英国和法国的能干外交部长。他从不回应对他人格的诽谤；在成为第二任总统后，亚当斯在为美国服务了四年的杰出时期默默地取得了优异的成绩。

虽然许多政府官员的资格和品格似乎值得怀疑，但我们有多少次为他们祈祷而不是责骂他们呢？保罗写道：“我劝你们……要为万人祷告、代求、祝谢；为君王和一切在位的，也该如此，使我们可以平安无事地度日。”（提摩太前书2：1-2）一切权柄都是上帝赐予的。

作为基督徒，我们投票的最好方式是下上膝盖的功夫（指祷告），而不是在投票箱里，总是要真诚地说：“不要照我的意思，只要照你的意思。”（马太福音 26：39）上帝的决定永远不会被投票所推翻。

万军之耶和华既然定意，谁能废弃呢？他的手已经伸出，谁能转回呢？- 以赛亚书 14:27
