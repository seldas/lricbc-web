**5/18/25 Pastor’s Word**
WE FIND FAITHFULNESS IN GOD’S WORD

Elinda West

Sharing at Morning Prayer Meeting on MAY 8, 2025

Isaiah 55: 10-11  “As the rain and the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish, so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater, so is my word that goes out from my mouth: It will not return to me empty, but will accomplish the purpose for which I sent it.”

This scripture is a beautiful picture in our minds of God’s creation and a testimony of  the power and the purpose of God’s Word! It wasn’t so long ago here in our city that we saw the beauty of the snow falling down to earth.

Even though it made traveling around difficult to impossible we have to admit we loved watching it !  It made us feel peaceful.  After that the rain came because it’s springtime and in the springtime we get rain to water the earth and make the grass grow and the flowers bloom and we have more beauty from seeing this season that God created for us to enjoy.

It seems like the birds even sing more happily in the springtime and we can enjoy their song. In verse 10 it uses this imagery of rain and snow. When they fall from heaven they don’t just evaporate and return. Instead they fulfill their purpose, watering the earth, making it fertile, and providing seed for the sower.

In the springtime likes to plant a little garden.  We do a simple garden because it is hard work to prepare, plant and take care of it.  We watch and hope and even pray for the vegetables to grow! We really enjoy going out to see the progress of the growing.

We look forward to the good food to eat! In verse 11 we see a parallel between the rain and snow and God’s Word. Just as the rain and snow fulfill their purpose, so does God’s Word . It will not return to Him empty, but it will accomplish what He intends and be successful in the task it was sent to do.

So God says this is how His Word works. His Word goes out from His mouth, and it doesn’t go right back to Him. It doesn’t return to Him empty. It accomplishes His purpose. His Word brings fruit and success! That’s what His Word does.

It succeeds in the thing it was sent for. In Isaiah 55: 10-11 God’s Word CHALLENGES us to be more than just listeners!  Let’s think about it…Doesn’t this lead us to pray that God’s Word in our hearts would bear this kind of fruit?

That we wouldn’t just hear the Word and then forget it. That we would receive God’s Word in a way that it bears fruit in our lives on a daily basis.  We should respond to God’s Word in obedience and action in our lives.

James 1:22 says, “Do not merely listen to the Word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says.” So if we do what God’s Word says there will be fruit flowing from our actions as a result of God’s Word in our lives.

Then we would spread God’s Word and remember that God’s Word is never intended to stop with us. It’s always intended to spread THROUGH us.

Even in this moment right now we are reading and hearing God speaking in Isaiah 55:10-11 about the power of His Word.

Who can we share the power of God’s Word with today? Who can we encourage today with God’s Word? Who can we share God’s Word with that may not know Jesus?

Just think about the opportunities for God’s Word to bear fruit in other people’s lives through us today! Just realize all of this is the purpose of God’s Word……for us to receive it, for it to bear fruit IN our lives, THROUGH our lives and IN the lives of other people as it spreads in the world.

That is His purpose! His Word goes out, that it might be made known in all the world through US as His people!  Isaiah 55: 10-11 ENCOURAGES us to let God’s Word shape every part of our lives and Isaiah 55:10-11 REMINDS us to pass God’s Word on to others!

Wei Mushr and I have shared with you before that in our time as missionaries in Taiwan we had many bible studies with different age groups. That’s how we connected and built relationships with people. We did our bible studies in English because the students wanted to improve their English and were excited to practice.

We could practice our Chinese with them, and they were so helpful and encouraging. They were not believers, but they still were eager to come for the English. We told them the textbook is the Bible God’s Holy Word!  Of course, they always got to hear the gospel.

Over the years some people believed but many did not.  Some didn’t believe right away but we stayed 32 years so we would hear from time to time that others came to believe.

They would find us and come tell us! We always told our students that to believe in Jesus was the most important decision they could make in their lifetime, and we told them it’s the one decision they would never ever regret.

But they had to decide for themselves. When the students finished the study we gave them a Bible as a gift.  So, this was a way we shared God’s Word and saw fruit.

Wei Mushr and I have a fasting day each week and pray scripture over our sons and their families. Now of course we pray every day for our children and friends and church. But this one day is a special day for them. They know we do this, so they often tell us things they want us to pray for. They depend on our prayers. We see God’s answers to the prayers! I also send bible verses to the grandchildren by text message. We don’t see them often, so we find it’s a good way to encourage them. We want them to know and remember God’s Word!  I know they might forget MY words but I’m trusting God’s Word will stay in their hearts and accomplish His purpose.

I also like to pray God’s Word over friends. I feel it is meaningful because it is God’s Word and much greater than my words. Wei Mushr and I also like to give Bibles as gifts to people here in America too, especially new believers like our neighbor Jack.

These are just some ways we share God’s Word by passing it on! We know you do these things and have other ways to share God’s Word with others. I will close by sharing the Words of Jesus in Matthew 28: 18-20 These words are called The Great Commission, “Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely, I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

There is a lot to say about these scriptures, but I will just say that Jesus reminds us to “teach them to obey everything (He) has commanded you.” And He will be with you to do it!  If WE are to obey Him, we must read His Word, respond to His Word with our actions and share His Word with others! God’s Word accomplishes His purposes and bears fruit in our lives and in other people’s lives through us. Thank you, Lord!

我们在神的话语中发现信实

魏愛玲師母

2025年5月8日早祷会分享

以赛亚书55:10-11 “雨雪从天而降并不返回，却滋润地土，使地上发芽结实，使撒种的有种，使要吃的有粮。我口所出的话也必如此，决不徒然返回，却要成就我所喜悦的，在我发它去成就的事上必然亨通”。

这段经文在我们的心中呈现了一幅美丽的图画，彰显了神创造的伟大，也见证了神话语的能力与目的！就在不久前，在我们的城市，我们看到了雪花从天而降的美丽景象。

尽管它让出行变得困难甚至几乎不可能，但我们不得不承认，我们很喜欢看着雪花飘落的样子！它让我们感到平静。之后下起了雨，因为是春天，春天的雨水滋润大地，使青草生长、花朵绽放，这一切都是我们从神所创造的季节中获得的美好。

好像春天的鸟儿也更欢快地歌唱，我们可以享受它们的歌声。第10节使用了雨雪的比喻。雨雪从天而降，并不会蒸发后就返回天上。它们履行了自己的使命；滋润大地，使其肥沃，并为撒种的人提供种子。

在春天，魏牧师喜欢种一个小花园。我们做一个简单的花园，因为准备、种植和照料它都是辛苦的工作。我们会看着它，希望它能成长，甚至会为蔬菜的生长祷告！我们非常喜欢去看植物生长的进展。

我们期待着能吃到丰收的食物！第11节将雨雪与神的话语进行了类比。就像雨雪履行了它们的使命，神的话语也是如此。它不会徒然返回，而是必定成就它所要完成的事，成功地完成它被差遣的任务。

因此，神说这就是他话语的运作方式。祂的话从祂的口中发出，并不会直接回到祂那里。它不空空返回，必定成就祂的目的。祂的话带来果实与成功！这就是祂话语的作用。

它成功地完成了祂差遣它去做的事。在以赛亚书55:10-11中，神的话语挑战我们不只是做听众！让我们想一想…这是不是在引导我们祷告，让神的话语在我们心中结出这样的果实？

我们不只是听见话语然后忘记它，而是要以一种使其在我们生活中每天结出果实的方式去接收神的话语。我们应该以顺服和行动来回应神的话语。

雅各书1:22说：“你们要行道，不要单单听道，自己欺哄自己。”因此，如果我们按照神的话语去做，我们的行为将结出果实，这是神的话语在我们生活中的结果。然后我们将传播神的话语，并记住神的话语从不只是为了停留在我们这里。它的目的是通过我们来传递出去。

即便在此刻，我们正在阅读并听见神通过以赛亚书55:10-11在讲述祂话语的力量。

今天我们可以与谁分享神话语的力量？我们今天可以鼓励谁，用神的话语来鼓励他们？我们能否与那些尚未认识耶稣的人分享神的话语？

想一想，今天神的话语如何通过我们结出果实，影响他人的生命！意识到这一切都是神话语的目的……让我们接收它，让它在我们的生活中结出果实，通过我们的生命，进入他人的生命，并在世界上扩展。

这就是祂的目的！祂的话语出去，使得祂的话语通过我们，祂的子民，让它在全世界被认识！以赛亚书55:10-11鼓励我们让神的话语塑造我们生命的每一部分，并提醒我们将神的话语传给他人！

魏牧师和我曾与大家分享，在我们作为台湾的宣教士的时光中，我们与不同年龄组的人开展了许多圣经学习。这是我们与人建立联系、培养关系的方式。我们用英语开展圣经学习，因为学生们想提高他们的英语水平，他们很兴奋能进行练习。

我们也能和他们练习中文，他们非常乐意帮忙、鼓励我们。虽然他们并不信主，但他们依然很乐意来参加英语学习。我们告诉他们，课本就是圣经，神的圣言！当然，他们总是听到福音的分享。多年来，一些人信主了，许多人没有。虽然他们并未立刻信主，但我们在台湾待了32年，因此我们时不时地听到有些人信主了。他们会找到我们并告诉我们！我们总是告诉我们的学生，信耶稣是他们一生中最重要的决定，并且是一个他们永远不会后悔的决定。但他们必须为自己做出决定。当学生们完成学习时，我们会赠送给他们一本圣经作为礼物。这就是我们分享神话语并看到果实的方式。

魏牧师和我每周都有一天禁食祷告，为我们的儿子和他们的家庭祷告圣经经文。当然，我们每天都会为我们的孩子、朋友和教会祷告，但这一天对他们来说是特别的一天。

他们知道我们会这样做，所以他们经常告诉我们他们希望我们为他们祷告的事情。他们依赖我们的祷告，我们看到了神回应祷告的答案！我也会通过短信给孙子们发圣经经文。

由于我们不常见面，所以我觉得这是一种鼓励他们的好方式。我们希望他们记住神的话语！我知道他们可能会忘记我的话，但我相信神的话会留在他们的心里，并成就祂的目的。

我也喜欢为朋友们祷告神的话。我觉得这样很有意义，因为那是神的话，比我的话更有力量。魏牧师和我也喜欢在美国赠送圣经给人，尤其是像我们的邻居Jack这样的新信徒。这些只是我们通过传递神的话语来分享它的一些方式。我们知道你们也在做这些事情，并且有其他的方式与他人分享神的话语。

我将以分享耶稣在马太福音28:18-20中的话语来结束。这段话被称为“大使命”，他说：“耶稣进前来，对他们说：‘天上地下的权柄都赐给我了。 所以，你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父子圣灵的名给他们施洗，凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守。 我就常常与你们同在，直到世界的末了。’”

这段经文有很多值得说的地方，但我只想说，耶稣提醒我们要“教训他们遵守我所吩咐你们的。”祂会与你同在去完成这个使命！如果我们要顺服祂，就必须读祂的话语，以行动回应祂的话，并与他人分享祂的话！神的话语成就了祂的目的，并通过我们在我们和他人生命中结出果实。感谢主！
