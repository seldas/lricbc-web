**10/6/24 Pastor’s Word**
HOW JESUS DEALT WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE

Elinda West

JAMES 1: 19-20; PROVERBS 22: 24; PROVERBS 29: 22

I very recently heard a sermon on these bible verses. I would like to share with you some thoughts from the pastor who preached that sermon. The pastor began his message by saying “controlling anger is a problem.” It seems to have become a bigger issue in today’s world. We see more violence, more rage, more hatred.  Of course, all of us will get angry sometimes. But as Christ followers, we need to control the way we respond to our anger! Today I want to talk more about ways to respond to those who spew out their anger toward us and how it shocks us and hurts us, especially if this anger toward us is from fellow believers.  It takes discipline and forgiveness to deal with anger directed toward us and the anger we ourselves feel at times and we need the help of the Holy Spirit for these situations.

When we look at James’ words, we see he is making a point, Dear Brothers, “take note of this”, “don’t ever forget”, “understand this” ......” be quick to LISTEN,” “it is BEST to LISTEN MUCH.” In other words, if we could take a few moments to recover from the hateful harsh words or hurtful actions and just think. Then James says, “slow to speak” ...... “slow to become angry,” “slow to take offense”! We need spiritual understanding in our hearing

(deep listening). That takes quick obedience to God’s Holy Spirit. We have to be filled with the Spirit daily to be ready for these moments.  It’s difficult to know how to respond sometimes because we are so shocked by anger. Most of the time it catches us off guard! Clearly the person showing their anger in that moment is committing a sin against us. Let’s be careful that we do not sin against them!  Listening deeply, carefully, always brings a better result.

Now we want to see what James is also wanting to remind us in vs 20, “for man’s anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.” In other words, anger doesn’t make us GOOD, as God demands we must be. Listen to something I read about these instructions from James,  “It is not enough to KNOW or even CHOOSE the right action: We must DO that action!  God does not seek righteous KNOWLEDGE; He seeks righteous LIVES!” We know that FAITH without works cannot be called FAITH.  Faith is more than words; it is MORE than KNOWLEDGE; it is demonstrated by OBEDIENCE.  Faith produces separation

from the world and submission to God! Faith provides us with the ability to resist the devil and humbly draw near to God! James is showing us that it is possible to believe right things and yet live the wrong way. James is so kind toward the brothers in dealing with this sensitive topic, but he gives specific practical instructions to help us live an authentic Christian life. James was Jesus’ half-brother yet he referred to himself as a “servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ”. That’s also who we are!  The challenge for us is to harmonize grace and truth with people and demonstrate Christ-like behavior. So, our goal is to project truth while also projecting grace.  We stand up for what is right while also showing the love of Jesus Christ.  Jesus faced a lot of angry people in his time on earth.  He did not become violent or careless. But he wasn’t a doormat either! (He didn’t let people walk all over him.) He confronted his enemies.  But instead of confronting with swords, daggers, threats, or insults, Jesus confronted his enemies with a forceful mixture of grace and truth.

We look to Jesus because he, better than anyone, understands anger and how to deal with being criticized or mistreated.   Some of the ways Jesus dealt with difficult people

### were:

1. JESUS ASKED QUESTIONS. Remember the story in Luke 12 when Jesus was challenged to settle a family dispute about the inheritance and he responded, “Man who made me a judge or an arbitrator over you?” “Watch out! Be on guard against all kinds of greed; a man’s life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions.” Jesus wanted them to understand putting material things over personal relationships has bad results! Jesus used questions to emphasize his openness to the other person.  Another thing Jesus did was

2. JESUS NEVER FELT PUSHED INTO A CORNER.  When the pharisees accused him of breaking the Sabbath by doing certain things Jesus wasn’t afraid of what they might think of him. That’s not his focus. Sometimes people corner us with their judgements, and we feel they misunderstand us or don’t know us.  But like Jesus we don’t have to feel defined by the projections of other people.  Our identity resides and is found in God, not what other people try to push on us.

3. JESUS KNEW WHEN TO IGNORE.  Remember in Luke 4 when Jesus returned to Nazareth his hometown and was reading the scripture in the synagogue and said, “no prophet was accepted in his own hometown.” He told about Elijah and the widow. All the people in the synagogue were furious with Jesus. They drove him out of town and wanted to throw him off the cliff.  Jesus could see there was no way to reason with these people, so he walked right through the crowd and “went on his way”.   Some people throw fits, speak abusively and harshly…. many times online in today’s modern time or in text messages. This is the time to walk away.  Sometimes people cannot be reasoned with, so you have no choice.  With in-person confrontation you might can choose another way.

4. JESUS WAS NOT ON THE DEFENSIVE.  In Mark 10 we see the request of James and John. “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask.” Jesus said, what do you want me to do? They asked to sit on Jesus’ right and left hand in Glory! They stepped over a boundary!  Jesus knows when to say NO and when to say YES and doesn’t worry about making people unhappy. Sometimes people demand more from us than what we can give. They may try to give us a guilt trip. Jesus loved all people, but his goal wasn’t to please everyone. Jesus’ goal was to do the Father’s Will. God’s will for Jesus gave him his security. He didn’t have to bend over backwards to satisfy needy or aggressive people. One other way Jesus dealt with other people.

5. JESUS WAS FLEXIBLE.  There’s a story in Matthew 15 about the faith of a Canaanite woman. The woman begged Jesus to heal her daughter. Jesus said, “No.” But then he was moved by her faith and heals her daughter.  Jesus approaches people with an open mind. When someone difficult comes our way. We might think, Oh, no, not again! But maybe we better keep an open mind. Things might be different this time. We don’t want to shut out the Holy Spirit’s work in our own life or another person’s life.

FRIENDS WE LOOK TO JESUS FOR OUR PERFECT EXAMPLE IN DEALING WITH DIFFICULT PEOPLE AND EVERYTHING ELSE IN OUR LIVES.  LIKE HIM, WE TOO, WILL BE ANGRY AND FEEL HATRED TOWARD SIN, HYPOCRISY, AND INJUSTICE.  THAT IS CALLED RIGHTEOUS ANGER AND IS OK. JESUS DID NOT EXHIBIT MAN’S ANGER BUT THE RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION OF GOD.  WE LOOK TO JESUS AS OUR EXAMPLE, BUT WE ARE WEAK AND WE WILL FAIL SOMETIMES! WE MUST PRAY AND FORGIVE AND KEEP TRYING TO DO BETTER ON THE ISSUE OF ANGER.

耶稣怎样对待难相处的人

魏师母

### 雅各书 1: 19-20；箴言 22: 24；箴言 29: 22

我最近听了一篇关于以上这些圣经经文的讲道。我想和大家分享一下那篇讲道的牧师的一些想法。牧师在讲道开始时说：“控制愤怒是一个问题。” 这似乎已成为当今世界的一个大问题。我们看到更多的暴力，更多的愤怒和更多的仇恨。当然，我们所有人有时都会生气。但作为基督徒，我们需要控制我们对愤怒的反应方式。今天，我想更多地谈谈如何回应那些向我们发泄愤怒的人，以及这种愤怒如何让我们震惊和受伤，尤其是当这种愤怒来自我们的弟兄姐妹时。我们需要节制和饶恕来处理针对我们的愤怒以及我们自己有时感受到的愤怒，我们需要圣灵的帮助来应对这些情况。

当我们看雅各的话时，我们看到他在强调一个观点，亲爱的兄弟们，“这是你们所知道的”（雅1: 19-20）：“注意这一点”，“永远不要忘记”，“理解这一点”......” 要快快的听”，多听是最好的。换句话说，如果我们能花点时间从仇恨的苛刻话语或伤害性行为中恢复过来，只是思考一下。然后雅各说，“慢慢的说”，“慢慢的动怒， ” “慢慢的动怒”。我们需要在听觉上有属灵的理解力（深入倾听）！这需要迅速服从上帝的圣灵。我们必须每天充满圣灵，为这些时刻做好准备。有时很难知道如何回应，因为我们被愤怒吓到了。大多数时候，它让我们措手不及。显然，在那一刻表现出愤怒的人正在对我们犯罪。让我们小心，不要得罪他们。认真、深入地倾听总会带来更好的结果。

现在我们来看看雅各在第 20 节中还想提醒我们什么，“因为人的怒气不能成就神所的义。”换句话说，愤怒并不能使我们变得善良，而神要求我们必须善良。听听我读到的关于雅各的这些指示，仅仅知道甚至选择正确的行动是不够的：我们必须采取行动。神不寻求正义的知识，他寻求正义的生活！我们知道没有行为的信心不能称为信心。信心不仅仅是言语；它不仅仅是知识；它通过顺服来体现。信心使我们脱离世界并顺服神。信心使我们有能力抵抗魔鬼并谦卑地接近神。雅各向我们展示了相信正确的事情却过着错误的生活是可能的。雅各在处理这个敏感话题上对弟兄们非常友善，但他给出了具体的实际指导来帮助我们过上真正的基督徒生活。雅各是耶稣同母的兄弟，但他却自称自己是 “神和主耶稣基督的仆人”。我们也是这样的人。我们面临的挑战是与人们协调恩典和真理，并表现出基督般的行为。因此，我们的目标是在展现恩典的同时展现真理。我们捍卫正义，同时也展现耶稣基督的爱。耶稣在世时面对过许多愤怒的人。他没有变得暴力或粗心大意。但他也不是一个软弱的人（。他不让人欺负他）他直面敌人。但耶稣不是用刀剑、匕首、威胁或侮辱来对抗，而是用恩典和真理的有力结合来对抗敌人。

我们仰望耶稣，因为他比任何人都更了解愤怒，也知道如何应对批评或虐待。耶稣处理难相处的人的一些方法如下：

1. 耶稣问问题。还记得路加福音第 12 章中的故事吗？当时耶稣被要求解决一个关于遗产的家庭纠纷，他回答说：“谁立我作你们断事的官？”“要谨慎！要防备一切贪心；人的生命不在乎家道丰富。”耶稣想让他们明白，把物质的东西置于个人关系之上会带来不好的后果。耶稣用问题来强调他对他人的开放态度。

2. 耶稣做的另一件事是，耶稣从未感到被逼入绝境。当法利赛人指责他做某些事情违反安息日时，耶稣并不担心他们会怎么看他。那不是他的重点。有时人们会用他们的判断逼迫我们，我们觉得他们误解了我们或不了解我们。但像耶稣一样，我们不必被别人的猜测所定义。我们的身份存在于上帝，而不是别人试图强加给我们的东西。

3. 耶稣知道何时该忽视。记得在《路加福音》第 4 章中，当耶稣回到家乡拿撒勒时，他在会堂里读经文时说：“没有先知在自己的家乡被人悦纳的。”他讲了以利亚和寡妇的故事。会堂里的所有人都对耶稣感到愤怒。他们把他赶出城外，想把他扔下悬崖。耶稣知道没有办法和这些人讲理，所以他直接穿过人群，“继续上路”。有些人会发脾气，辱骂和粗鲁……在当今现代的网络上或短信中，这种情况屡见不鲜。这是离开的时候了。有时人们是不讲道理的，所以你别无选择。当面质问时，你也许可以选择另一种方式。

4. 耶稣没有采取防御措施。在马可福音第 10 章中，我们看到雅各和约翰的请求。“夫子，我们无论求什么，愿你给我们成就。”耶稣说，你们要我做什么？他们要求在荣耀中坐在耶稣的左右手边。他们越界了。耶稣知道什么时候说不，什么时候说是，并且不担心让人们不高兴。有时人们对我们的要求超出了我们所能给予的。他们可能会试图让我们感到内疚。耶稣爱所有的人，但他的目标不是取悦所有人。耶稣的目标是遵行天父的旨意。上帝对耶稣的旨意给了他安全感。他不必竭尽全力去满足有需要或咄咄逼人的人。这是耶稣与他人打交道的另一种方式。

5. 耶稣很灵活。马太福音第 15 章讲述了一个迦南妇人的信心故事。这个妇人恳求耶稣医治她的女儿。耶稣说： “不。”但后来他被她的信心感动，治愈了她的女儿。耶稣以开放的心态对待人们。当一个难相处的人来找我们时，我们可能会想，哦，不，不会再来了。但也许我们最好保持开放的心态。这次情况可能会有所不同。我们不想拒绝圣灵在我们自己或他人生活中的工作。

朋友们，我们将耶稣视为我们完美的榜样，像他那样处理生活中的棘手问题和所有其他问题。像他一样，我们也会生气，也会对罪恶、虚伪和不公感到憎恨。这被称为正义的愤怒，这是可以接受的。耶稣没有表现出人的愤怒，而是表现出上帝的义愤。我们视耶稣为榜样，但我们很软弱，有时会失败。我们必须祈祷、宽恕，并继续努力在控制愤怒方面做得更好。
