PRACTICING GRATITUDE, PART ONE

Scripture Reading: Genesis 1:12, Mark 6:37-44

Gratitude is a spiritual practice that helps you notice and appreciate God’s work in your day to day. In this plan you’ll learn 4 different techniques for making gratitude a part of your daily life.

We would like to thank the Theology of Work Project for providing this plan. For more information, please visit www.theologyofwork.org/devotions.

Gratitude is a spiritual practice of seeing and celebrating the good in the world around you. This is easier said than done.

Modern life often forces you to focus on what is bad – what needs to be fixed immediately, what crisis must be prevented, what new thing you need now to make your life better.

Learning to notice the good takes practice. Thankfully, every time you flex your gratitude muscle you get stronger. You get positive feedback – it feels good to be grateful. And you connect with God who is the source of all goodness.

You don’t need to look for big miraculous things to be grateful for. Jesus showed that gratitude can begin with very little. On a day when it seemed like he and his friends wouldn’t have enough to eat, Jesus looked up to heaven and thanked God for the food they had (Mark 6:37-44). When Jesus did this, the little they had turned into an abundance.

Start your gratitude practice by simply noticing what is good in the world around you. This goes back to the very first chapter of the Bible, when God “sees” what is good in his creation (Genesis 1:12).

### Practice:

What is good in the world around you right now? If the seat you’re sitting on is comfortable, thank God for that.

During your day, make it a point to notice one thing that’s good. If a coworker smiles at you, this can be a prompt to gratitude.

Before you go to bed tonight, think back on your day. What was good today that you can thank God for? Make a list.

Prayer: God, thank you for the good you have put in my life today. Reveal yourself to me through your goodness. In Jesus’ name, Amen.”

操练感恩一

### 阅读经文：创世记 1:12，马可福音 6:37-44

感恩是一种属灵操练，帮助你察觉并感谢神在日常生活中的作为。在这个计划中，你将学习 4 种不同的技巧，让感恩成为你日常生活的一部分。

感谢《工作神学项目》为我们提供这个计划。欲了解更多信息，请浏览：https://zh-hant.theologyofwork.org/ 灵修材料。

感恩是理解和赞美周围世界美好事物的一种属灵操练。这说来容易，做来却不容易。

现代生活常常迫使你专注于不好的事情——哪些需要立即修复，哪些危机必须预防，你现在需要什么新东西才能让生活变得更好。

学习察觉美好的一面需要操练。幸运的是，每当你展现感恩的心时，你就会变得更擅长。你会得到正面的反馈——心存感恩的感觉真好。而且这会让你与神连接，祂是一切良善的泉源。

你不需要寻找伟大的神迹奇事来感恩。耶稣示范感恩可以从很小的事情开始。那一天，当耶稣和祂的朋友们似乎没有足够的食物时，祂抬头望着天，感谢神赐给他们已有的食物（马可福音 6:37-44）。当耶稣这样做时，他们所拥有的一点点就变成了丰盛。

透过简单地察觉周围世界的美好事物，开始你的感恩操练。这可以追溯到圣经的第一章，神“看着”祂的创造是好的。

### 操练：

现在你周围的世界有什么是美好的？如果你坐的座位很舒服，感谢神。

在你的一天中，特别察觉一件美好的事。如果同事对你微笑，这可能是感恩的提醒。

今晚睡觉前，回想一下今天的经历。有些什么美好的事可以感谢神？列一个清单。

### 祷告：

神啊，感谢祢今日为我的生命带来益处。借着祢的良善显明祢自己。奉耶稣的名祷告，阿们。
