**5/19/24  Pastor’s Word**
Martin Luther’s Preface to The Epistle to the Romans

(Continue from above)

Ch. 3—All Men are Sinners

24. In the third chapter the apostle casts them all on the same heap, saying that one is no better than the other, and all of them are sinners in the sight of God. The only difference is that the Jews have had the Word of God, though many of them did not believe it. But that has not made the faith and truth of God of no effect. Incidentally, the apostle introduces the passage from Psalm 51:4, which declares that God is righteous whenever He judges. This point he takes up again in what follows and proves by the Scriptures that all are sinners and no one is justified by the deeds of the Law, but that the Law has been given only that man might know sin.

Salvation by Grace

25. Next the apostle begins to teach the true way of becoming godly and being saved. He says:—‘All have sinned and come short of the glory of God.’ They must all be saved without any merit of theirs, by faith in Christ, who has earned our salvation by shedding His blood. He has been set before us as a Mercy-seat by God, who forgives us all our past sins. In this manner he proves that only the righteousness which God gives to faith can help us. This righteousness was revealed at that time by the Gospel, but had been witnessed previously by the Law and the prophets. Thus the Law is established by faith, and the deeds of the Law, together with their glory, are dashed to the ground by this argument.

Ch. 4—Good Works the Outward Signs of Faith

26. Having revealed sin in the first three chapters and having taught the way of faith unto righteousness, the apostle now begins to meet several objections and claims. First, he takes up the one which is commonly advanced by all when they hear that faith justifies without works. They say: Are we, then, not to do any good works? He reminds himself of Abraham and says: What has Abraham accomplished with all his works? Was it all in vain? Did his works not benefit him at all? He winds up by declaring that Abraham was justified without any works, by faith alone, so much so that prior to the work of circumcision he is extolled in Scripture as a righteous man solely for the sake of his faith. Gen. 15:6. Now, if the work of circumcision, which God enjoined upon him and which was a goodly act of obedience, contributed nothing to his righteousness, surely no other good work will contribute anything to a person’s righteousness. But just as the circumcision of Abraham was an external sign, exhibiting his righteousness by faith, so all good works are merely external signs flowing from faith and, as good fruits, attesting that a person is already inwardly righteous in the sight of God.

27. By this argument, as by a powerful example drawn from Scripture, St. Paul establishes his former teaching concerning faith in chap. 3:27, and, in addition, introduces another witness, David, in the thirty-second psalm, who also says that man is justified without works, although he does not remain without works after he has become justified. Continuing, he expands the example which he has introduced, so as to make it cover all other works of the Law, and concludes that the Jews cannot be the heirs of Abraham because of their descent, much less on account of the work of the Law, but that, if they wish to be genuine heirs, they must inherit Abraham’s faith, inasmuch as Abraham was justified by faith and called the father of the faithful prior to the Law, both that of Moses and that of circumcision. Moreover, the Law works wrath rather than grace, because no one obeys the Law willingly and from love; hence by the Law comes disfavour rather than grace. Therefore it must needs be that faith alone obtains the mercy promised to Abraham. These examples have been recorded also for our sakes, in order that we might believe.                                                    (to be continued)

马丁·路德的《罗马书》序言

（接上文）

第三章——所有人都是罪人

24. 在第三章中，使徒将他们归为同一类，说这个人并不比那个人好，他们在神眼中都是罪人。唯一的区别是犹太人拥有神的话语，尽管他们中的许多人不相信它。但这并没有使神的信心和真理失效。顺便说一句，使徒介绍了诗篇 51 篇 4 节中的一段话，其中宣称神无论何时施行审判，都是公义的。他在接下来的内容中再次提到这一点，并通过圣经证明所有人都是罪人，没有人能因律法的行为而称义，但律法的颁布只是为了让人认识罪。

靠恩典得救

25. 接下来使徒开始教导成为敬虔和得救的真正方法。 他说：“世人都犯了罪，亏缺了神的荣耀。”他们都必须靠着对基督的信仰而得救，而无需靠自己的任何功劳，基督通过流血为我们赢得了救恩。神已将他摆在我们面前作为施恩座，赦免我们过去所有的罪孽。 他以这种方式证明，只有神赋予信仰的公义才能帮助我们。这种义是当时由福音所揭示的，但之前已被律法和先知所证实了。因此，律法是借着信仰而建立的；通过这个论证，律法的行为及其荣耀都被彻底粉碎了。

第四章——善行是信心的外在标志

26. 使徒在前三章揭示了罪，并教导了因信称义的道路，现在开始遇到一些反对观点和主张。首先，他谈到了所有人在听到“信心不需行为就可以称义”时普遍提出的观点。 他们说：那么，我们难道就不要做任何善事吗？他提醒自己关于亚伯拉罕，并说：亚伯拉罕的一切行为成就了什么？难道这一切都是徒劳的吗？难道他的善行对他一点好处都没有吗？他最后宣布亚伯拉罕称义，无需任何行为，仅凭信心，以至于在割礼之前，他在圣经中已被称为义人，完全是因为他的信心（创15:6）。 如果上帝吩咐他行割礼，这是一种良好的顺服行为，但对他的义没有任何贡献，那么其他善行肯定不会对一个人的义有任何贡献。但是，正如亚伯拉罕的割礼是一个外在的记号，表明他因信而称义一样，所有的善行也只是出于信心的外在记号，作为善果，证明一个人在上帝眼中已经是内在的公义了。

27. 通过这一论证，正如从圣经中提取的有力例子一样，圣保罗确立了他之前在第 1 章中关于信仰的教导（3:27）。此外，在诗篇第32篇中，保罗介绍了另一位见证人大卫，他也说，人不靠行为就称义，尽管他在称义之后，并不是仍然没有行为。接下来，他展开了他所介绍的例子，使其涵盖了律法的所有其他工作，并得出结论，犹太人不能因为他们的血统而成为亚伯拉罕的后裔，更不用说因为律法的工作了。但是，如果他们希望成为真正的继承人，他们就必须继承亚伯拉罕的信心，因为亚伯拉罕因信称义，并被称为先于律法（摩西律法和割礼律法）的信徒之父。此外，律法产生愤怒而不是恩典，因为没有人自愿地、出于爱而遵守律法。因此，律法带来不悦而不是恩典。因此，唯有信心才能获得应许给亚伯拉罕的怜悯。这些例子也是为了我们的缘故而记录下来的，以便我们可以相信。                                                   （未完待续）
