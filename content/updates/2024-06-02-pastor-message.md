**6/2/24 Pastor’s Word**
“Godly Living”:  A Review of Pioneers 2024

In the seventh chapter of John Bunyan’s The Pilgrim’s Progress, it is written that Christian arrived at the “Beautiful Palace” on his way to heaven, where he met “Watchful,” “Discretion,” “Prudence,” “Piety,” and “Charity,” and had in-depth fellowship with them. This description often reminds me of the significance of Christians attending “spiritual retreat” or “spiritual camp.” The theme of the 2024 Pioneers camp is “Godly Living.” The conference demonstrates the need for Christians to live a godly life through collective gatherings, workshops, Sunday worship, small group devotional, testimonies, personal communication, and entertainment activities. “Godly living” is not a slogan, but a lifestyle and attitude. There were 251 people participating in the camp, and there were 26 adults and children from our church. This year is my 14th time participating in the camp. I would love to share a few points.

1. Cross-church activity deepens the concept of kingdom ministry

The camp brought together many churches in the southwestern United States and even the whole country, which demonstrated the kingdom concept of the church. It is very dangerous for a local church to work in isolation, sitting in a well and looking at the world. The Lord wants the members of churches everywhere to connect with each other, just like the branches of grapes are connected to the vine, so that they can bear more fruit for the Lord. The keynote speaker of the conference was Dr. Kuo-Tsai Tan, the president of Taiwan Baptist Theological Seminary. His many testimonies made the Chinese churches in North America more aware of the needs of Taiwan Baptist Theological Seminary and made us connect with each other and pray for each other more. The four messages he delivered: The Bible - the book of God’s Breath, Obey the Word of the Lord and Abide in Him, The Ability to Love and Obedience, and The Glorious Choice lifted people up. His words “serving the Lord is not doing great things for Him, but following Him who does great things” are impressive to everyone. Adding the “Apostles’ Creed” during worship shows respect and inheritance for church traditions.

2. God's family is prosperous and has successors

14 years ago, there were few children at the camp; but 14 years later, there are many children. Among them, several teenagers served as hosts, from them we see a hope for the future of the Chinese churches in USA. The keynote speaker and translator were father and son. It was the first time for the father and the son to serve the Lord on the same podium. It was a beautiful testimony to the Lord. During Sunday worship, dozens of children sang a song. Special thanks to the Sunday school teachers for being kind and allowing my two-and-a-half-year-old son Elijah to walk around in the children's choir as a “patrol policeman.” After the worship, a sister who had just entered the first year of college shared her experience. She emphasized that her choice of college was based on her Christian faith, that is, to see if the college has a good Christian faith foundation. After she came to the new college, she prayed to seek a spiritual church home, and after finding the church, she further committed herself to becoming a church member. This testimony broke the superstition people said that children would stay away from the church after entering college and let us see the spiritual pursuit in college that a born-again Christian should have.

3. A translator benefits a lot from translation service

---
**Pastor Larry Spargimino said to me, “You can translate well because the conference gave you so many opportunities.” Indeed, service is an opportunity. We should seize every opportunity to serve. It is a blessing to be a translator because the translator can carefully study the message before the worship, and listen to every word carefully during the sermon, and then quickly switch between Chinese and English. During the Sunday worship, Pastor Danny Lee’s message was titled “God Knows,” the text was Psalm 139. The message emphasized four aspects of Psalm 139: God knows our habits and behaviors (1-6), God knows our thoughts and intentions (7-12), God knows our strength and temperament (13-18), and God knows our weaknesses and temptations (19-24), as well as their respective practical significance, that is, I remain honest in my choices in life, no longer explore sinful behaviors, seek a relationship with God to better understand myself, and seek God's guidance against temptations. The two illustrations cited in the message, “The Flash” and “The Screwtape Letters” by British Christian writer C.S. Lewis (refer to https://cmchurch.org/the-screwtape-letters-cs-lewis/) are also very interesting.**
4. Fellowship and prayer strengthen our faith

At the camp, many brothers and sisters fellowshipped and prayed with each other. A sister from a Houston church shared that a 14-year-old girl with leukemia in her church was taken home by the Lord. The girl led her unbelieving father to accept the Lord while in the hospital bed, and she also led her grandmother to accept the Lord. Many people attended her memorial service. Everyone was very sad, but the church was greatly revived because of her. Her testimony also inspired the faith of countless people. Another sister shared with me that as a single mother, the most meaningful thing she did for her child was to take him to church. She was very relieved that her child had started working. She said: “Children who grow up in the church have the Lord in their hearts; children who grow up in the church, parents can have a platform and content to talk with them based on the Bible, because the Bible is the truth.” She encouraged me and said: “Your church must do the second-generation ministry well! The second-generation ministry is so important! Most of the first generation of Israelites who left Egypt failed in the wilderness, and the second generation all entered Canaan. The failure of the first generation was complain, and the example of the second generation was faith.” Her sharing was inspiring.

The theme of the 2025 Pioneers will be “Be United in Christ.” Next year, Pioneers will celebrate its 25th anniversary. We pray that the Pioneers will bless more and more people! We pray that more brothers and sisters will participate next year for the Lord’s revival and presence! In the name of Christ, Amen!

“敬虔的生活”

——记2024年明日之光营会

约翰·班扬所著《天路历程》第七回中讲到，基督徒在天路途中到了“富丽宫殿”（The Beautiful Palace），他在那里遇到 “儆醒” (Watchful)，机灵（Discretion），审慎（Prudence），敬虔（Piety）和慈善（Charity），并与他们有深入交通。这段描述常使我联想到基督徒参加“培灵会”或“退修会”的意义。2024年明日之光营会的主题是 “敬虔的生活”。大会通过集体聚会，工作坊，主日崇拜，小组灵修，见证分享，个人交通，娱乐活动等展示基督徒需要活出敬虔的生活。敬虔生活不是口号，而是一种生活方式和态度。营会有251人参加，我们教会大人孩子有26人。今年是我第十四次参加，有如下几方面体会。

1.    跨教会活动加深国度胸怀

营会聚集美国西南部乃至全美许多教会，这加强了教会国度性观念。一间当地教会闭门造车、坐井观天是很危险的。主愿意各地教会肢体彼此联络，如葡萄枝连于葡萄树一样，为主多结果子。本年大会主讲员是台湾浸会神学院院长谭国才博士，他的许多见证使北美华人教会更多了解台湾神学院的需要，使我们彼此联络，互相代祷。他带来的四篇信息：“圣经——上帝呼气的书”，“聆听主话、住在主里”，“爱与顺服的能力”，和“荣耀的抉择”使人受益匪浅。他所说“服侍主不是为主作大事，而是跟随作大事的主”让每个人记忆犹新。大会崇拜时加上“使徒信经”，表明对教会传统的尊重和继承。

2.    神家兴旺后继有人

14年前营会上小孩子很少，14年后有许多小孩子。其中，有几位青少年担任主持，让我们看到教会未来的希望。大会主讲员和翻译上阵父子兵，父子第一次同台服侍上帝，美好传承，为主作见证。主日崇拜时，有几十位儿童献诗。特别感谢主日学老师的友善，允许我两岁半的儿子李天成在儿童诗班的队伍里走来走去作“巡逻警察”。崇拜后，一位刚入大学一年级的姐妹分享，强调她重生得救后选择大学的依据是该大学信仰的好坏。她入学后通过祷告寻找属灵的教会，找到教会后又进一步委身成为教会会友。这个见证打破人们常说孩子们进大学之后就远离教会的迷信，让我们看到重生得救基督徒应有的大学灵性追求。

3.    翻译服侍获益良多

Larry Spargimino牧师对我说：“你之所以能翻译好，是因为大会给你那么多机会”。的确如此，服侍是机会。我们要抓住每次服侍的机会。作翻译很蒙福，因为可以提前认真学习牧师要传讲的信息，并要在讲道时认真听讲，听清楚每句话后、快速进行中英语言切换。主日崇拜时，李报森牧师信息的题目是“神知道”，经文：诗篇139篇。信息强调了诗篇139篇中的四个方面：神知道我们的习惯和行为（1-6），神知道我们的想法和意图（7-12），神知道我们的特长和性情（13-18），神知道我们的软弱和试探（19-24），以及它们分别的实践意义，即我在生活中的选择上保存诚实，不再探索罪恶的行为，寻求与上帝的关系更好地认识自己，并促使我寻求上帝的引导抵御试探。信息中所举的两个例子“闪电侠”和英国作家路易斯的“地狱家书”（推荐https://cmchurch.org/the-screwtape-letters-cs-lewis/）也很有趣。

4.    交通代祷增添力量

营会上很多弟兄姐妹互相交通代祷。休斯顿教会的一位姐妹讲到，他们教会有一位患白血病的14岁女孩被主接走了。女孩儿在病床上带领一项刚硬的父亲决志信主，她也带奶奶信主。 许多人参加她的追思礼拜。她离世大家都很难过，但是教会却因她大大复兴了。她的见证也激励了无数人的信心。另一位姐妹和我分享，她作为单亲妈妈为孩子作的最有意义的事就是带他去教会。孩子已经开始工作了，她倍感欣慰。她说：“在教会长大的孩子心里有主；在教会长大的孩子，父母能与他们有对话的平台和内容——圣经，因为圣经是真理”。她鼓励我说：“教会一定要好好培养第二代！第二代信主太重要了！出埃及的以色列人第一代多数都倒闭旷野了，第二代都进了迦南。第一代的失败是埋怨，第二代的榜样是信心”。姐妹的分享很有启发。

2025年明日之光大会的主题是“在基督里合一”。明年明日之光将庆祝25周年。我们祈祷明日之光越办越好，祝福更多人的生命！我们祈祷明年有更多弟兄姐妹参加，经历主的复兴和同在！以基督之名，阿门！

周一到周五早5：00，周六早6：00。每次一个小时。周日没有。由弟兄姐妹轮流带领，欢迎弟兄姐妹参加。Zoom ID:501.501.7777,密码:777。
