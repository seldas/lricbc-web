2024 Church Vacation Summer Bible School

KJV Matt.19: 14 But Jesus said, “Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.”

Jesus’ words of Matthew 19: 14 are the basis and foundation for our church’s children ministry. The Lord Jesus taught us: “Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them.” On one hand, the original text of “let” is an imperative tone. The Lord commands us to invite children to come to Him. On the other hand, let’s not hinder them. “Hinder” means not to allow, to obstruct or to set up obstacles. The KJV translates “hinder” as “suffer,” which means to endure. This reminds us to tolerate and put up with little children. Children are not always lovable, sometimes they can be mischievous or restless. Yet the Lord asks us to welcome them. A church with many children is filled with the Lord’s presence, vitality, and blessings. A church that prohibits children from entering is hardly be called the Lord’s church.

Vacation Bible School (VBS) is an outreach ministry provided by the church to the community. It aims to educate children to know God, including faith courses, arts, crafts, games, etc. Each church can design its own faith curriculum or purchase a suitable faith curriculum. Our church successfully held the first VBS last year (please refer to https://thebaptistpaper.org/little-rock-chinese-church-thankful-for-year-of-growth-unity-and-answered-prayers /), praise the Lord.

We had our first preparatory meeting for 2024 last Sunday to determine the following.

Date: June 18-21, 5:30-8:00 pm (“Friday Family Night”); volunteers will arrive at 5pm to set up tables and chairs.

Vision: Strive to spread the gospel of Christ, share the love of Christ with children and parents, and help people to know the Lord.

Purpose: Focus on the gospel, highlight the characteristics of the Chinese church, and make the activities interesting and fun.

### Goal: 40 children

2024 Theme: SCUBA, with the ocean world as the background, it will lead children to dive into a relationship with the Lord.

We divide into several groups and need relevant volunteers:

1. Teaching Team; 2. Mission Team; 3. Craft Team; 4. Worship and Praise Team; 5. Food Team; 6. Reception and Registration Team; 7. Decoration Team; 8. Promotion Team; 9. IT Team; 10. Photography and Video Team; 11. Youth Preparation Team for the Play of “The Book of Jonah”

Welcome to actively sign up to participate in VBS or VBS volunteers. Brothers and sisters who are interested in serving, please contact Mrs. Shasha if you have any questions.

2024年教会暑期圣经学校

太19:14耶稣说：“让小孩子到我这里来，不要禁止他们，因为在天国的正是这样的人。”

太19：14耶稣的话是教会作儿童事工的依据和基础。主耶稣教导我们说：“让小孩子到我这里来，不要禁止他们”。从积极角度说，“让”原文是命令语气，主命令我们邀请小孩子到他面前。从消极角度说，我们不要禁止他们。“禁止”是不许可，阻挠或设置障碍的意思。KJV将“禁止”翻译成“Suffer”，有受苦和忍受的意思。这提醒我们要容忍和忍受小孩子。小孩子不总是可愛的，他们有时会调皮或不安静，然而主让我们欢迎他们。有小孩子的教会充满主耶稣的同在、生命力和祝福。禁止小孩子入内的教会，则很难被称之为主的教会。

暑期圣经学校（Vacation Bible School, 英文简称 “VBS”）是教会向社区提供的外展服侍，旨在教育孩子认识上帝，包括信仰课程、艺术、手工艺、游戏等。每间教会可以设计自己的信仰课程或购买适合的信仰课程。我们教会去年成功地举行了第一次VBS（请参考https://thebaptistpaper.org/little-rock-chinese-church-thankful-for-year-of-growth-unity-and-answered-prayers/），荣耀归于主。
