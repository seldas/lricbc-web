**1/4/26 Pastor’s Word**
“Coworker Sharing Day” Reflection

According to our church tradition, the last Sunday of each year is designated as “Coworker Sharing Day”. On this day, we take the opportunity to thank all the coworkers for their service and to encourage every brother and sister to serve more faithfully in God’s house.

The theme for the 2025 Coworker Sharing Day was “Serving in the Body.” Scripture references: 1 Corinthians 12:12-27; Colossians 3:23.

The church had a total of twelve brothers and sisters sharing, ranging in age from the youngest coworker at ten years old to the most senior servant at seventy-eight. In the love of the Lord, we are united, and we can see that every brother and sister actively participates in service. One brother said, “Many churches often have 20% of the people doing 80% of the service, but in our church, at least 80% of the brothers and sisters are involved in serving.” I would like to add: 100% of our church members are serving. Of these, 80% serve on the front, and 20% serve behind the scenes. Brothers and sisters may serve by praying, giving, supporting, constantly sharing the gospel, or setting up or putting away tables or chairs. We are all engaged in the Lord’s work. Whether on the front or behind the scenes, nothing is too small, and every act of service is pleasing to the Lord. Truly, this is worthy of thanksgiving!

Through the sharing of brothers and sisters, I have summarized a few things:

1. We Seek Vision Together

Proverbs 29:18 says, “Where there is no vision, the people perish.” Our general direction is clear: the Lord Himself is our vision (bold). Therefore, the theme of the church for the entire year is “Fixing Our Eyes on Jesus” (Heb. 12:1–2).

Rev. Ron mentioned that the church should be Christ-centered and love-guided, becoming a church that proclaims the gospel, is united in love, and prays for one another. Of course, our church certainly needs to find our own place of worship.

One brother shared that the church’s fellowship must be built on love and truth. He also encouraged more brothers to courageously stand up, share visions, and participate in building, trusting the Lord to revive His church together with us.

2. All Our Service Points to the Lord (bold)

All services in the church are for the Lord, not for people. Serving for people leads to weariness, but serving for the Lord brings joy. Every church meal is prepared abundantly. Brothers and sisters actively cooperate every Sunday, taking turns bringing snacks and cleaning. Each family is scheduled to provide snacks about twice a year and assist in cleaning three times a year. Every Sunday, coworkers arrive early to prepare sound equipment, arrange Bibles and bulletins, boil water, and prepare coffee, quietly ensuring the smooth running of the gathering.

One sister shared that without the guidance of the Holy Spirit, one cannot bear fruit by oneself. When the Lord led her to consistently send daily devotionals via WeChat, dripping water wears through stone, and the seeds of the gospel quietly took root and sprouted in people’s hearts over time.

3. Children and youth are not the church of the future, but the church of today

We thank the Lord for preparing Brother Chris to serve our youth. The service of our children and youth inspires us all. Their service includes playing piano, sharing mission stories in VBS, distributing food at each gathering, and more. In the “passing the torch” program, youth teach children, children teach the little ones, and even the youngest can share with toddlers. The torch of God’s house is being passed on. One child quoted Paul: “Don’t let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, and in purity” (1 Tim. 4:12).

4. Strengthen Church Ministries

Paul said, “If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed” (1 Cor. 16:22). Paul is not cursing people; he is stating a spiritual truth: when people do not love the Lord, they inevitably love themselves or the world, and loving self and the world results in falling under a curse.

The church has weekly worship, Sunday School, evangelism classes, Friday fellowships, Wednesday prayer meetings, and daily morning prayers, forming the regular spiritual life of the church. We do not love the Lord because we serve; we serve because we love the Lord. We do not want to treat these gatherings as routine, but to respond with our lives and serve the Lord.

5. Outreach

Evangelism is the great commission entrusted to the church by the Lord. One pastor once said, “A church that does not evangelize is a self-destructive church; a church where every brother and sister actively shares the gospel will not experience internal conflict.” Therefore, we seize every opportunity in ministries and activities—whether Easter, Christmas, Mother’s Day, church special meetings, or VBS—to actively invite people and courageously share the gospel.

The church will continue organizing Holding Jesus Banners in English, Chinese, and Spanish, sharing the gospel with all nations. We do not ask about results; we focus on faithful sowing. Do not lose heart in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest.

Looking ahead to 2026, I want to challenge every member: each person should find a way, led personally by the Holy Spirit, to share the gospel; each person should daily pray for 3–5 the lost on their prayer list; and each person should persistently evangelize, faithfully responding to the Lord’s great commission.

6. Press On Through Challenges

After the meeting, a sister shared, “Hearing everyone’s testimonies, the greatest feeling is that everyone has challenges.” Indeed, every person faces challenges, and these are measured by the Lord according to what each can bear. Remember, when we serve the Lord, we will also face the enemy’s attacks. When we seek to impact the kingdom, the enemy is not pleased. But when we can recognize the enemy’s schemes and bravely push forward through the Lord, the joy that follows comes from Him.

A few days ago, a brother shared during morning prayer: on a certain Sunday, the church had scheduled his daughter’s baptism, but that morning she became ill. He prayed earnestly and, in faith, still brought her to church. After her baptism, she was completely healed.

Facing challenges, we rely not on ourselves but on the Lord to overcome. It is precisely through challenges that we learn to trust Him more deeply, serve Him persistently, and allow our lives to be shaped and renewed by the Lord.

In short, Luke 17:10 says, “So you also, when you have done everything you were told, say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done our duty.’”

After finishing work, Chinese people like to say, “You have been laboring hard!” or “That you are made to bear toil!” God’s children should say instead: “You are blessed!” or “You are so blessed!”

Hallelujah! How blessed are God’s children! How blessed it is to serve the Lord!

“同工分享日”心得体会

按照我们教会的传统，每年最后一个主日是“同工分享日”。借此机会，我们感谢众同工的服侍，并激励每位弟兄姐妹更好地在神家中服侍。

2025年同工分享日的主题：“在身体里服侍”。经文：林前12：12-27，西3：23。

教会共有十二位弟兄姐妹作了分享，年龄从最小的十岁同工，到七十八岁的资深仆人。在主的愛中，我们彼此联结，看见每一位弟兄姐妹都积极参与服侍。一位弟兄说：“许多教会往往是 20% 的人承担了 80% 的服侍；但在我们教会，至少有 80% 的弟兄姐妹都在参与服侍”。我也想补充一句：我们教会100%的人都在服侍。其中，80%的人在台前服侍，20%的人在幕后服侍。弟兄姐妹或代祷、或奉献、或支持、或默默与人分享福音、或摆放或收起桌椅，我们都在做主的工。无论是台前还是幕后，事奉无小事（nothing is too small），每一样服侍都是主所悦纳的，实在值得感恩！

### 通过弟兄姐妹的分享，我总结几点：

我们共同寻求异象

箴言 29:18 说：“没有异象，民就放肆。”我们的总体方向很清楚：主自己就是我们的异象。因此，教会全年的主题是 “仰望耶稣”（来 12:1–2）。

魏牧师提到，教会当以基督为中心、以愛为准绳，成为一个传福音、合一相愛、彼此代祷的教会。当然，我们的教会一定需要找到自己的聚会场所。

有弟兄分享：教会的团契必须建立在愛与真理上。他也鼓励更多弟兄勇敢站出来，一同分享异象，参与建造，靠主共同复兴祂的教会。

我们各样的服侍都要指向主

教会中一切的服侍，都是为主而做，不是为人而做。为人做，越做越累；为主做，越做越喜乐。教会每次聚餐都预备得丰盛有余。弟兄姐妹在每个主日都积极配合，轮流带零食、清扫卫生。按安排，每个家庭一年大约两次负责准备零食、三次参与清洁服侍。每个主日，都有同工早早来到教会，预备音响设备，摆放圣经和周报，烧好热水，准备咖啡，为聚会顺利进行默默付出。有一位姐妹分享说，若没有圣灵的感动，人凭自己实在不能结出果子。当主感动她每日坚持通过微信发送经文灵修时，滴水穿石，福音的种子便在人的心中悄然撒下，慢慢孕育、发芽，产生影响。

儿童青少年不是教会的未来，而是教会的今天

感恩主预备了Chris 弟兄服侍我们的青少年。我们的儿童和青少年在教会中的各样服侍鼓舞着我们。他们的服侍包括司琴、VBS 宣教分享、每次聚餐分发食物等。在薪火相传项目中，青少年教儿童，儿童教小小朋友，小小朋友也可以与幼儿分享。神家接力棒的火炬正在传递。有位小朋友引用保罗的话说：“不可叫人小看你年轻；总要在言语、行为、愛心、信心、清洁上，都作信徒的榜样”（提前4：12）。

加强内部事奉

保罗说：“若有人不愛主，这人可诅可咒”（林前 16:22）。保罗并不是在咒诅人，而是在陈述一项属灵事实：当人不愛主时，必然是在愛自己或愛世界里；而愛自己、愛世界的结果，就是使人落在咒诅之中。

教会每周有主日崇拜、主日学、慕道班、周五团契、周三祷告会，以及每日晨祷，构成教会正常的属灵生活。我们不是因服侍而愛主，而是因愛主而服侍；也不愿把这些聚会当作例行公事，而是以生命来回应主、事奉主。

向外拓展

传福音是主托付给教会的大使命。有位牧者曾说：“不传福音的教会是自杀的教会；每位弟兄姐妹都积极传福音，教会才不会内耗。”我们要抓住每一次事工与活动的机会——无论是复活节、圣诞节、母亲节、教会特会，还是 VBS——积极邀请人参加，勇敢与人分享福音。

教会将继续安排为耶稣举牌（英文、中文、西班牙语）的外展行动，向万国万民分享福音。我们不问结果，只问忠心耕耘；行善不可丧志，到了时候就必有收成。

展望 2026 年，我想挑战每一位家人：每个人都要找到一种圣灵亲自指教、适合你与人分享福音的方式；每个人每天都要在祷告中为 3–5 位慕道友的救恩代求；并且坚持不懈地传福音，忠心回应主的大使命。

在挑战中前进

散会后，有一位姐妹分享说：“听到大家的见证，最大的感受是——每个人都有挑战。”是的，每个人都有挑战，这些挑战都是主按着我们各人所能承受的程度量给我们的。切记：当我们要为主做工时，也会受到仇敌的攻击。当我们要产生天国影响力时，仇敌不会高兴。但当我们能够识别仇敌的诡计，靠着主勇敢地冲过去，随后所经历的，往往是从主而来的喜乐。

前些日子，一位弟兄在晨祷会上分享：有一个主日，教会安排他女儿受浸，但当天早晨孩子突然又拉又吐。他迫切祷告后，凭信心仍带女儿来到教会。当孩子受完浸礼后，她就完全康复了。

面对挑战，我们不是靠自己，而是靠主去战胜；也正是在挑战中，我们学习更深地信靠主，坚持不懈地服侍上帝，生命也因此被主塑造和更新。

### 结语：

路加福音 17:10中说：“这样，你们作完了一切所吩咐的，只当说：我们是无用的仆人，所作的本是我们应分作的。”

在做完工之后，中国人喜欢说：“你受累了！”“你辛苦了！”主的儿女应该说：“你蒙福了！”“你有福了！”

哈利路亚，神的儿女何等有福！事奉上帝何等有福！
