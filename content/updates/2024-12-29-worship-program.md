Scriptures for Co-workers Sharing Day  
1不要为作恶的心怀不平，也不要向那行不义的生出嫉妒。2 因为他们如草快被割下，又如青菜快要枯乾 。3   你当倚靠耶和华而行善，住在地上，以他的信实为粮 ; 4 又要以耶和华为乐，他就将你心里所求的赐给你。5 当将你的事交托耶和华，并倚靠他，他就必成全。6他要使你的公义如光发出，使你的公平明如正午。  
* **1.** Do not fret because of those who are evil or be envious of those who do wrong; 2 for like the grass they will soon wither, like green plants they will soon die away. 3 Trust in the Lord and do good; dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture. 4 Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart. 5 Commit your way to the Lord; trust in him and he will do this: 6  He will make your righteous reward shine like the dawn, your vindication like the noonday sun.
* **3.** 我凭着所赐我的恩，对你们各人说：不要看自己过于所当看的，要照著神所分给各人信心的大小，看得合乎中道。4 正如我们一个身子上有好些肢体，肢体也不都是一样的用处。5 我们这许多人，在基督里成为一身，互相联络作肢体，也是如此。6 按我们所得的恩赐，各有不同。或说预言，就当照着信心的程度说预言；7 或作执事，就当专一执事；或作教导的，就当专一教导；8 或作劝化的，就当专一劝化；施舍的，就当诚实；治理的，就当殷勤；怜悯人的，就当甘心。9  爱人不可虚假；恶要厌恶，善要亲近。10爱弟兄，要彼此亲热；恭敬人，要彼此推让。11殷勤不可懒惰。要心里火热，常常服事主。12在指望中要喜乐，在患难中要忍耐，祷告要恒切 。13圣徒缺乏要帮补；客要一味的款待。
* **3.** For by the grace given me I say to every one of you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you. 4 For just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do  not all have the same function, 5 so in Christ we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. 6 We have different gifts, according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance with your faith; 7 if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach; 8 if it is to encourage, then give encouragement; if it is giving, then give generously;  9 Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil; cling to what is good. 10 Be devoted to one another in love. Honor one another above yourselves. 11 Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. 12 Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer. 13 Share with the Lord’s people who are in need. Practice hospitality.
