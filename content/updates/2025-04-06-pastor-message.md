**4/6/25 Pastor’s Word**
Testimony of Student H

On Sunday, March 30th, during our church’s Sunday school, we had a discussion about evangelism. It led the brothers and sisters to deeply reflect on the essence of the gospel of Christ and the methods of sharing the gospel.

On Monday, March 31st, at 2:47 PM, I received a text message from an old friend (my former mentor; we had served together for many years):

“Do you remember helping Student H find a house and prayed for him? He came to Christ and was baptized 2 weeks ago. Amazing!!”

I was very surprised when I heard this news. How could this happen? Some people spend so much time sharing the gospel with others, yet they still don’t believe. But this student was baptized so quickly.

I vividly remember that in early October last year, H went to my university in another state that I graduated from to study music. At that time, he was struggling to find housing. Through his teacher’s introduction, he called me. I told him, “I left the city more than six years ago, and I have lost touch with most of my connections.” After talking with him for a while, I asked, “Can I pray for you? May the Lord prepare a place for you.” He said, “Okay.” After I prayed, God quickly provided for him. He later told me, “Thanks to your prayer, I rented a house close to school at a very affordable price yesterday!” Later, he testified, “Your prayer was really effective!” I responded, “Thank the Lord! It’s not that my prayer was effective—every Christian’s prayer is powerful. It’s just that God had prepared me at that moment to pray for you. If I hadn’t prayed for you, the Lord would have arranged someone else to do the same thing.”

Hearing that he had been baptized, I was extremely excited. I immediately called my old friend and H to ask where he had been baptized. My old friend told me, “In our simple house church’s swimming pool.” My friend shared that this morning, he had taken H to meet a pastor. Coincidentally, this pastor had just visited our Little Rock Immanuel Chinese Baptist Church last Friday. When the pastor mentioned my name, H immediately said, “I know him! He prayed for me.” It was amazing that the Lord arranged for me to share in the joy of H’s baptism in such a way.

H told me that he plans to return to China in two weeks. He has decided to become a pastor (or an evangelist). He said, “Music cannot save people—only the gospel can. What the Chinese people need most right now is Jesus.” He further explained, “The Lord will still allow me to use my music to praise Him or to earn a small income, but my main goal will be to preach the gospel to others.”

Below is his written testimony before his baptism:

I’ve been trying to find the right way to live my life all the time, I have believed in many ways such as money, science, philosophy, music and so on.

But they all ended up failing, now I know it’s because they are all human stuff which are not solid or reliable, they have inadequate foundation, but God loves me and brought me here, and showed me the truth that Jesus Christ is the only path.

I started learning the Bible with suspicion, but I want to know the truth so I’ve always been seeking, I am so lucky that God arranged me to meet a friend who became my teacher and always answers my questions with patience and love.

Finally on last Saturday, a voice came out of my mind while I was lying on my bed, “Jesus I believe you, Jesus I want to follow you”, I knew that was Jesus calling me. Then all the suspicions were gone and I believed in all the things in Bible. I felt so much peace and joy, I felt all my sin was washed to clean, I started to thank God and I started to pray for my family and my friends.

My faith is growing stronger and stronger day by day, I will keep reading the Bible in the future and try to send the gospel to more people.

Further Sharing on Tuesday Night

On Tuesday evening, I had a Zoom meeting with H, where he shared more of his story. I also gave him some encouragement and counsel. I invited him to share his faith journey, and he said:

“First of all, when I was five years old, my grandma took me to a church. I clearly remember reciting the Lord’s Prayer. One time, my grandma prayed for me, asking the Lord to give me wisdom and understanding. Since then, for all these years, I have been seeking wisdom in my heart.

Later, when I was in college, I took a course on ‘Western History.’ When we studied the religious section, the professor played a video about ‘The Life of Jesus.’ As I watched, I was moved to tears. At that time, I had a bit of faith and even attended two or three church gatherings. However, I did not continue.

Last October, when I arrived in USA, a senior schoolmate introduced me to the Baptist Collegiate Ministry (BCM) on campus, where I met Sister A. She introduced me to a friend. In January this year, this friend invited me to join a study group called ‘Bible Discovery Group,’ which met every Tuesday night. One thing I really appreciated about this group was that the study method was not about being indoctrinated. Instead, we read the Bible together and were encouraged to discover the truth on our own. After eight weeks of study, as I read the Bible myself, the Lord gradually opened my heart. He allowed me to see clearly that the Bible is truly full of wisdom—it is absolutely not something humans could have made up. One night, I listened to the book of Ephesians. The impact was so powerful that it overwhelmed me. That night, I heard Jesus calling me, and I decided to fully commit myself to Him and follow Him completely."

A Life Transformed

Looking back on his journey, H is especially grateful for that old friend’s companionship, encouragement, patience in answering his questions, inviting him for tea, and showing him care.

He also shared that his parents divorced when he was two years old. He had a very poor relationship with his grandma, father, and mother, and he had not spoken to them for a long time. He did not even call his biological mother “Mom” but instead referred to her as “Old Lady.” However, the second day after he became a Christian, he reconciled with his grandma, father, and mother. He also started calling his mother “Mom.” Praise the Lord! It was the Holy Spirit that changed his life and taught him to forgive.

The Lord’s Work in Evangelism

We are grateful for H’s testimony of Christ’s transformative power. Along the way, many people shared the gospel with him—his grandmother, his teacher, and my old friend. Those who came before were sowers, and my old friend was the one who nurtured and harvested. When it comes to evangelism, it is not about what we can do—it is about what God can do. God Himself calls people and does the work. He arranges everything so that one sows, another waters, and another reaps the harvest.

“Sow your seed in the morning, and at evening let your hands not be idle, for you do not know which will succeed, whether this or that, or whether both will do equally well.” (Ecclesiastes 11:6)

Let us give all the glory to the Lord, for though we labor, it is He who produces the fruit! Hallelujah! The Lord’s work is marvelous, wonderful, and truly amazing! Let us continue to pray for C’s faith and his future ministry plans. May the Lord continue to guide and protect him. In the name of Christ, Amen!

H同学的见证

上周日3月30日教会主日学讨论关于传福音，使弟兄姐妹对基督福音的本质及传福音的方法等方面有许多深入反思。

这周一3月31日下午2: 47，我收到一条老朋友（我之前的导师；我们一起同工多年）给我发来的短信：

“你还记得曾帮助H同学找房子并为他祷告吗？他已经信主，并在两周前受了浸礼。太奇妙了！”

我听到这个消息非常好奇。怎么会有这样的事呢？有的人弟兄姐妹花多少时间给他们传福音，他们都不信。这位同学怎么这么快就受了浸礼。我清楚记得，去年10月初H去我从前毕业的学校学习音乐。当时他找房子找不到，经他的老师介绍打电话找到我。我和他说：“我离开那里已经6年多了，之前的联络都找不到了。”我和他沟通了一下，然后对他说：“我为你做个祷告可以吗？求主为你预备。”他说：“好的”。祷告完后，神真的很快就预备了。他说：“幸亏您的祈祷，我昨天租到了离学校很近而且很便宜的房子！”后来，他见证说：“你祷告真灵啊！”。我回答说：“感谢主，不是我祷告灵，每个基督徒祷告都灵，只是神在那个时间预备我来为你祷告。如果不是我为你祷告，主也会预备别人的”。

我听说他受了浸礼感到非常兴奋，马上打电话给我的老朋友和H，问H在哪里受的浸礼？老朋友告诉我：“在我们简单家庭教会的游泳池里（Our simple house church in a swimming pool）”。老朋友分享到，今天上午我带着H去见一位牧师。恰巧这位牧师上周五刚来我们小石城教会分享。那位牧师提到春海时，H马上说：“我认识他。他给我祷告过”。太神奇了，主居然以这种方式让我可以有份与分享H受浸礼的好消息。H告诉我说，他打算过两周回国了。他决定将来去作牧师（或传福音的人）。他说：“音乐不能救人，只有福音能。中国人现在最需要的是耶稣。” 他进一步说：“主依然让我用音乐赞美他或赚一点儿微薄的收入，但我的主要目标将是给别人传讲福音”。

### 以下是他受浸礼前的文字见证：

我一直在寻找正确的生活方式，我曾经相信金钱、科学、哲学、音乐等等。

但最终它们都失败了，现在我明白了，那是因为这些都是人的东西，它们并不坚固可靠，根基不够稳固。

然而，神爱我，把我带到了这里，向我展现了真理——耶稣基督才是唯一的道路。

起初，我带着怀疑开始学习圣经，但我渴望知道真理，所以一直在寻求。

我很幸运，神安排我遇到了一位朋友，他成为了我的老师，总是耐心而充满爱地回答我的问题。

终于，在上周六，当我躺在床上时，脑海里突然响起一个声音：“耶稣，我相信你，耶稣，我愿意跟随你。”

我知道，那是耶稣在呼唤我。

那一刻，所有的怀疑都消失了，我相信了圣经中的一切。

我感受到前所未有的平安和喜乐，我感觉我的罪被完全洗净了。

我开始感谢神，并且为我的家人和朋友祷告。

我的信心正一天天地增长，我会继续读圣经，并努力向更多的人传扬福音。

周二晚进一步分享

周二晚上我和H有个Zoom 会议，听到他更多的分享；并同时给他一些鼓励和劝勉。我请他分享一下他的信仰之旅。他说：

“首先，我5岁时奶奶带我去教会。我清楚记得当时背诵主祷文。奶奶有一次为我祷告，求主赐予我智慧和聪明。此后这么多年来，我在心里一直寻求智慧。

后来，在我上大学时选修一门课程《西方历史》。讲到宗教这个部分时，老师给我们放“耶稣生平”影片。我看影片时流泪了。我当时有点儿信，也曾参加过2-3次聚会。 之后就没有再继续。

去年10月来到美国，经一位师姐介绍我去参加校园里的浸信会大学事工(Baptist Collegiate Ministry，简称BCM)认识了A姐妹。A姐妹将我介绍给老朋友。老朋友今年1月份开始带领参加每周二晚上的查经称为“圣经探索小组”(“Bible Discover Group”)，这个小组学习的优点是学习采用的不是灌输式的，而是在一起读经，以启发的方式鼓励每个同学自己发现真理。经过8周的学习，我自己读圣经，主使我的心慢慢被打开。主让我清楚地看到，圣经真是有智慧，绝对不是人能编出来的。有一天晚上我听《以弗所书》，这本书的冲击力实在是太大了。那天我听到耶稣的呼唤，便决志信主，完全跟随耶稣”。

生命的转变

他一路走过来，特别感谢老朋友的陪伴、鼓励、耐心回答我各样疑问、请我喝茶、关心我。他还补充说到，他两岁时父母离异。他和奶奶、爸爸、妈妈的关系都非常不好，而且已经很长时间不说话了。他管自己的亲妈不叫妈，叫“老娘”。他信主后第二天就与奶奶、爸爸和妈妈和好了。他也开始管亲妈叫“妈”了。感谢主，是圣灵改变了一个人的生命，让人学会了饶恕。

传福音中上帝的工作

我们为H见证基督的生命而感恩，他能够信主，一路上经历许多人曾和他分享福音：他奶奶、他老师、老朋友。前面的人都是撒种者，老朋友是耕耘和收割者。在传福音这件事上，不是我们能作什么，是神能作。神自己呼召人做工。神就是这样安排，这人撒种、那人收割。“早晨要撒你的种，晚上也不要歇你的手，因为你不知道哪一样发旺；或是早撒的，或是晚撒的，或是两样都好”（传11：6）。我们要将荣耀归于主，因为做工的在我们，结果子在乎主！哈利路亚，主的作为奇妙、奇妙、真奇妙！让我们继续为H的信仰和未来事奉计划代祷祝福，求主继续引导保守他。以基督之名，阿门！
