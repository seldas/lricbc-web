**3/2/25 Pastor’s Word**
THE POWER OF A GRATEFUL HEART

Elinda West

On February 7, 2025, Early Morning Prayer

Scriptures: Psalm 9: 1-2; Hebrews 13: 15-16; Psalm 28:7; Psalm 100:4

At the beginning of the New Year 2025 I was thinking about what changes I could make in my life, habits, and attitude! I had felt like I had been in a season of over-thinking, over-worrying about our children and grandchildren and their future.

Also, Wei Mushr and I are in that age of life that we see more and more friends who are losing their mate or facing terminal illness or disability or facing some other crisis that is sad or painful and discouraging. We often get a message or phone call about a deep struggle in a friend’s life. We are attending more and more memorial services.

On top of that, our culture, our world is becoming more disturbing!! Certainly, Wei Mushr and I pray for all these things daily and we have many friends we keep in touch with to pray for and encourage.  I’ve shared before that 3 years ago we also began to fast and pray one day each week particularly for our children and grandchildren.

Sometimes it seems they aren’t seeing the spiritual battle we live in or at least not taking it seriously. For example, they know spending too much time on the iPhone and iPad is wrong, they might even feel a little guilty, but they don’t seem concerned about the seriousness of it or try to put restrictions on it. They are young and immature. We feel they don’t take time as young adults to have devotions or go to church regularly as they’ve gotten older.  I know God hears and answers our prayers and I know He doesn’t want us as parents to stress about or focus on all these concerns and lose our sleep over it.

I made the conscious decision in this New Year 2025 to start being more focused on a thankful, more grateful heart for the work I know God is doing in their lives even if I don’t see it yet.  It is God’s plan that I and all of us parents rest in Him not losing sleep over our family or our friends’ burdens.

I have asked God to forgive me for not trusting Him and I decided that in the daytime or in the night, if the worries, the concerns began to trouble me I would immediately say, “Thank you God, I know YOU are working in all these people I care about!  You are leading, convicting, protecting and comforting all of them because you love them so much, too!”

I will never stop praying for and encouraging my children and grandchildren or my friends.  I will never stop taking every opportunity to remind them of the riches and blessings that come from walking closely with Jesus…. the wisdom and peace and joy they can have put Him first in their life and looking to Him for everything.

As you know God’s Word tells us to be joyful always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God’s will for us!  God loves a grateful heart because it invites His presence!!  He delights in our thankfulness!  A grateful heart deepens our trust in God and strengthens our faith.  It inspires JOY!

This plan of mine for the New Year to really focus on having a thankful and grateful heart was working pretty well for me and I felt it was helping me and God was pleased with it!   I would start to go back to the old habit…. worry, think too much, pray…. stay awake in the night then, I would immediately start my “Thanksgiving Prayers” to the Lord. It gave me great peace and soon I would go back to sleep.

Then I got sick!  No big deal, right?!

The sickness continued for one week, two weeks, three weeks. I would get a little better then when it came back. I kept having to go back to the Dr to get new medicine …4 weeks, 5 weeks and then Wei Mushr got sick too and I continued to not feel well.

My sickness wasn’t so terrible!  It was annoying and frustrating because I couldn’t seem to get well and I think I’m healthy for my age!  Wang MaMa always says her sickness is just “Xiao Shi Qing” (meaning “a small thing”). So, this really was a small thing compared to so many people I knew.

Since the Lord knows all things, he also knew we would have this little struggle in our health right AFTER I decided to focus on thanksgiving and a grateful heart. It was His Plan to USE THIS STRUGGLE to make me stronger in my trust of Him! Our struggles always make us stronger in our faith!

What is interesting is that even though I was frustrated about it I wasn’t so troubled by it.  I was continuing all my “Thanksgiving Prayers” …. thankful for my Drs, all of you brothers and sisters praying for each other, Wei Mushr taking care of me.  I WILL get well; I have confidence in God’s healing power!

So, today I wanted to just share a little about 7 Things that the POWER of a grateful heart can do:

1. It gets our eyes off ourselves and helps us to focus back on God.

2. It reminds us of we’re not in control, but that we serve a Mighty God who is.  It keeps us in a place of humility and dependency on Him, as we recognize how much we need Him.

3. It helps us to recognize we have so much to be thankful for, even all the little things, which often we may forget to thank Him for…but they really are the biggest, most important things in this life.  It takes our attention off our problems and helps us reflect on and remember the Goodness of His many blessings.

4. It reminds us that God is the Giver of all good gifts.  We were never intended to be fully self-sufficient in this life.  A grateful heart reminds us that ultimately God is our Provider, that all blessings and gifts are graciously given to us by His hand.

5. A heart of gratitude leaves no room for complaining. It is impossible to be truly thankful and filled with negativity and ungratefulness at the same time.

6. It makes the enemy run away!  The forces of darkness can’t stand to be around hearts that give thanks and honor God!  Our praise and thanksgiving will make the enemy leave!!

7. It opens the door for continued blessings. It invites His presence. Our spirits are refreshed and renewed in Him.  God loves to give good gifts to His children. He delights in our thankfulness and pours out His Spirit and favor over those who give honor and gratitude to Him.  Let’s practice a grateful thankful heart every day!

感恩之心的力量

魏愛玲師母

2025 年 2 月 7 日 清晨祈祷会

经文：诗篇 9: 1-2；希伯来书 13: 15-16；诗篇 28: 7；诗篇 100: 4

2025 年新年伊始，我在思考我可以对我的生活、习惯和态度做出哪些改变！

我感觉自己处于一个过度思考、过度担心我们的孩子和孙子以及他们的未来的时期。

魏牧师和我都处于人生的这个年龄，我们看到越来越多的朋友失去伴侣，或面临绝症或残疾，或面临其他令人悲伤、痛苦和沮丧的危机。我们经常会收到关于朋友生活中遇到的严重困难的信息或电话。我们参加的追悼会越来越多。

除此之外，我们的文化、我们的世界正变得越来越令人不安！当然，魏牧师和我每天都会为这些事情祈祷，我们也与许多朋友保持联系，为他们祈祷和鼓励。 我之前分享过，三年前我们也开始每周禁食祈祷一天，特别是为我们的孩子和孙子。

有时他们似乎没有看到我们所处的属灵争战，或至少没有认真对待它。例如，他们知道花太多时间在 iPhone 和 iPad 上是错误的，他们甚至会感到有点内疚，但他们似乎并不关心这件事的严重性，也不会试图对此进行限制。他们年轻，不成熟。我们觉得，随着他们年龄的增长，他们在年轻时没有时间进行祷告或定期去教会。 我知道上帝听到并回应了我们的祈祷，我也知道祂不希望我们作为父母因为这些担忧而感到压力或专注，甚至因此失眠。

在 2025 年新年里，我做出了一个有意识的决定，开始更加感恩，更加感激上帝在他们生活中所做的工作，即使我还没有看到。 上帝的计划是让我以及我们所有的父母都安息在祂里面，不会因为家人或朋友的负担而失眠。 我请求上帝原谅我不信任他，我决定无论是白天还是晚上，如果担心、忧虑开始困扰我，我会立即说：“感谢上帝，我知道您在我关心的所有人身上发挥作用！ 你正在带领、感化、保护和安慰他们所有人，因为你也非常爱他们！”

我永远不会停止为我的孩子、孙子和朋友祈祷和鼓励。 我永远不会停止抓住每一个机会来提醒他们与耶稣同行所带来的财富和祝福……他们将拥有智慧、平安和喜乐，把耶稣放在他们生命的首位，并在一切事情上仰望他。如你所知，上帝的话语告诉我们要常常喜乐，不住地祷告，在任何情况下都要感恩，因为这是上帝对我们的旨意！ 上帝喜爱一颗感恩的心，因为感恩的心能带来上帝的存在！ 祂因我们的感恩而喜悦！ 感恩的心会加深我们对上帝的信赖并增强我们的信仰。 它激发了快乐！

我的新年计划是真正专注于拥有一颗感恩和感激的心，这个计划对我来说非常有效，我觉得它对我有帮助，上帝也对此感到高兴！ 我会开始回到旧习惯……担心，想太多，祈祷……晚上保持清醒，然后我会立即开始向主做“感恩祈祷”。它让我感到非常平静，很快我就会重新入睡。

然后我就生病了！ 没什么大不了的吧？病情持续了一周、两周、三周。当我的情况好转一点时，它就会再次复发。我必须不断回到医生那里开新药……4 周、5 周后，魏牧师也生病了，我仍然觉得不舒服。

我的病并没有那么严重！ 这真是令人恼火和沮丧，因为我似乎无法好起来，而我认为以我的年龄来说我是健康的！ 王妈妈总说自己的病只是“小事情”。所以与我认识的很多人相比，这真的是一件小事。

因为上帝无所不知，所以祂也知道，在我决定专注于感恩和感恩的心之后，我们的健康会遇到一点困难。我们的奋斗总会让我们的信念更加坚定！

有趣的是，尽管我对此感到沮丧，但我并没有因此而感到困扰。 我继续我所有的“感恩祷告”……感谢我的医生，感谢所有互相祈祷的兄弟姐妹，感谢魏牧师照顾我。 我会康复的，我对上帝的治愈能力有信心！所以，今天我想分享感恩之心的力量可以发挥的 7 件事。

第一，它让我们不再专注于自己，而是帮助我们重新将注意力集中在上帝身上。

第二，它提醒我们，我们无法掌控一切，但我们侍奉的是一位全能的神。它让我们保持谦卑，依靠他，因为我们认识到我们多么需要他。

第三，它帮助我们体认到，我们有太多值得感恩的事情，即使是所有小事，我们常常会忘记感谢祂……但它们确实是我们生命中最大、最重要的事。 它使我们的注意力从问题上转移，并帮助我们反思和记住祂的诸多祝福的美好。

第四，它提醒我们上帝是一切美好礼物的赐予者。 我们从来没有打算在今生实现完全自给自足。 感恩的心提醒我们，最终上帝是我们的供应者，所有的祝福和礼物都是祂慷慨地赐给我们的。

第五，心存感恩，就不会有抱怨。人们不可能同时真正心存感激和充满消极和忘恩负义。

第六点，它让敌人逃走！ 黑暗势力无法忍受存在于感恩和敬畏上帝的心灵周围！ 我们的赞美和感恩会让敌人离开！

第七点，它为持续的祝福打开了大门。它邀请主的同在。我们的灵性在祂里面得到焕然一新和重生。上帝喜欢给祂的孩子好的礼物。祂喜悦我们的感恩，并将祂的灵性和恩惠倾注给那些敬畏和感激祂的人。 让我们每天练习一颗感恩的心！
