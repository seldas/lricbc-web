FIRST DEVOTIONAL

Early PRAYER Meeting

At Little Rock Immanuel Chinese Baptist Church

NOVEMBER 6, 2024

Jerry &amp; Marily Fine

Song – The Lord’s Prayer

GOOD MORNING! We are excited to be with you this morning for this special PRAYER TIME.

We want to start with a story of a man that God used to CHANGE our lives THROUGH HIS PREACHING &amp; TEACHING ON PRAYER.

HE WAS THE PASTOR OF THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH IN NORMAN, OKLAHOMA.

His name was E. F. Hallock, who liked to be called “Preacher.”

“Preacher” went to a MODERNISTIC  Seminary WITH VERY LIBERAL TEACHINGS and did not believe in miracles or the Virgin birth etc. but he thought that the Bible had good stories that he could TEACH &amp; PREACH.

After preaching for 7 years, he invited an Evangelist to preach in his church.

The evangelist preached the Gospel and the first night “Preacher” was under conviction and struggled all night.

The next night, “Preacher” had the courage to walk down the aisle of his own church and say, “I’ve never trusted Jesus as my personal Lord and Savior,” BUT he did that night.

From that night forward he devoured the Word of God – BY THAT WE MEAN – he

read,

studied,

memorized,

AND MEDITATED ON IT he said, “I set out to MASTER the Bible, BUT I soon found it was MASTERING me.”

By saying he meditated on it, we believe:

He PONDERED the word of God – he thought seriously about what God was saying to him personally.

He PICTURED the scene or situation in his mind – and ask himself who do I identify with in the picture

He PRAYED what he experienced in the Word – A PRAYER OF DEVOTION TO GOD.

and YOU COULD TELL IT IN HIS PREACHING.

He read Bible completely through - at least once a year to 4 times a year from GEN 1:1 to REV 22:21

Always remember the Bible was written for you:

Romans 15:4 NKJV – “For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through the patience (OR PERSERANCE) and COMFORT of the Scriptures might have HOPE and we see HOPE AS A (confident expectation of what’s to come)

EVERY MESSAGE “Preacher” preached WHICH WAS 3 TIMES PER WEEK was on AT LEAST ONE, of the following:

Always in Prayer.

Saturating our life with God’s Word.

Living by God’s Promises both – General and Specific, Personal Promises.

In fact, Preacher wrote a little book on ALWAYS IN PRAYER, and on the back cover of this book he wrote:

### “To pray in the name of Jesus is:

to be SO attached to Him, SO united to Him:

that His thoughts become my thoughts;

His desires become my desires;

His life becomes my life;

His nature becomes my nature;

His prayers are my prayers, and my prayers are His prayers.”

Ephesians 6:18a says “praying always with all prayer &amp; supplication in the Spirit…”

The devotional thought WE want to leave with you today is what “Preacher” wrote on the back cover of his book – ALWAYS IN PRAYER – Which means pray about everything in your life every day:

### EXAMPLE:

JERRY – When I go out to mow our lawn – I pray Lord, let the lawn mower start this morning

MARILYN – Woke up yesterday singing the Lord’s Prayer &amp; asked God to let the man who was in a Concert, at our church, to sing and play the Lord’s prayer &amp; it happened as she had asked.

And Romans 12:12 “Rejoicing in HOPE, patient in TRIBULATION, continuing Steadfastly in PRAYER.

Tomorrow morning, we will discuss with you how to make the thoughts “Preacher” wrote on the back of his book – YOUR OWN so that others might say these things about you.

——2024 年 11 月 6 日小石城以马内利华语浸信会晨祷会

第一篇灵修

### •    诗歌 — 主祷文

### •    早上好！ 我们很高兴今天早上能和你们一起参加这个特别的祈祷时间。

•    我们想以一个人的故事开始，上帝通过他的讲道和教导祈祷来改变我们的生命。

### •    他是俄克拉荷马州诺曼市第一浸信会的牧师。

### •    他的名字是 EF Hallock，他喜欢被称为“传道人”。

•    “传道人”去了自由派神学院，那里的教义非常自由，不相信神迹或童女生子等，但他认为圣经中有许多好故事，他可以去教导和宣讲。

### •    传道 7 年后，他邀请了一位布道家来 他的教会。

### •    布道家宣讲福音，第一天晚上“传道人”深陷悔恨，整夜挣扎。

•    第二天晚上，“传道人”鼓起勇气走在自己教堂的过道上说： “我从来没有相信耶稣是我个人的主和救主。” 但 那天晚上他确实这么做了。

### •    从那天晚上起，他开始吞噬上帝的话语——我们的意思是——他

o    诵读，

o    研读，

o    背诵，

### •    经过默想后，他说： “我开始掌握圣经，但我很快发现圣经正在掌握我。”

### •    通过说他对此进行了默想，我们相信：

### •    他沉思上帝的话语——他认真思考上帝对他说的话。

### •    他在脑海里描绘出当时的场景或情况——并问自己，我在画面中自己是谁

### •    他按照自己在圣经中所经历的去祈祷——向上帝虔诚的祈祷。

### •    和你可以从他的讲道中看出来。

### •    每年至少读一次到四次圣经，从创世纪 1:1 到启示录 22:21

### •    永远记住圣经是为你写的：

•    罗马书 15:4 NKJV – “从前所写的圣经，都是为教训我们写的，叫我们因圣经所生的忍耐（或毅力） 和安慰，可以得着盼望。我们将盼望视为（对未来的信心期待）

### •    “传道人”每周讲道三次，每次讲道至少包括以下其中一项：

### •    不住地祈祷。

### •    用上帝的话语充实我们的生活。

### •    持守上帝的应许——一般的和具体的、个人的应许。

### •    事实上，传道人写了一本关于“时刻祈祷”的小书，在这本书的封底他写道：

### •    “奉耶稣的名祷告就是：

### *如此地依赖于他，如此地与他合一：

*他的思想成为我的思想；

*他的愿望成为我的愿望；

*他的生活成为我的生活；

*他的本性成为我的本性；

*他的祈祷就是我的祈祷，我的祈祷就是他的祈祷。”

### •    以弗所书 6:18a 说“靠着圣灵，随时多方祷告祈求…”

•    今天，我们想要留给你们的灵修思想是“传道人”在他的书的封底写的——时刻祈祷——这意味着每天为生活中的一切祈祷：

### •    例子：

*杰瑞 – 当我出去修剪草坪时，我祈祷上帝，让割草机今天早上启动

*玛丽莲——昨天醒来时唱着主祷文，并祈求上帝让在我们教堂音乐会上的那位男士唱主祷文并演奏出来，事情正如她祈求的那样发生了。

### •    罗马书 12:12 “在盼望中要喜乐，在患难中要忍耐，祷告恒切。”

•    明天早上，我们将与您分享如何让“传道人”在书的背面写下的想法成为你自己的想法，以便其他人也可以对你谈论这些事情

周一到周五早5：00，周六早6：00。每次一个小时。周日没有。由弟兄姐妹轮流带领，欢迎弟兄姐妹参加。Zoom ID:501.501.7777,密码:777。
